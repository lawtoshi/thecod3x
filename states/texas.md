# 2.44 - Texas

## Overview

Texas has emerged as one of the most significant U.S. jurisdictions for cryptocurrency and blockchain activity. The state's approach combines a business-friendly regulatory philosophy with meaningful consumer protection enforcement, creating an environment that has attracted major industry players — particularly in mining, where Texas hosts roughly 3,200 megawatts of capacity across dozens of facilities, representing an estimated 40% of U.S. Bitcoin hashrate.

Three pillars define the Texas framework. First, the state integrated virtual currency into its Uniform Commercial Code in 2021, becoming only the second state (after Wyoming) to provide clear property rights and secured transaction rules for digital assets. Second, the 2023 Money Services Modernization Act drew a deliberate line between stablecoins (regulated as money transmission) and other virtual currencies (generally excluded), while a companion statute imposed proof-of-reserves and anti-commingling requirements on digital asset service providers in the wake of FTX's collapse. Third, Texas in 2025 became the first state to actually fund a strategic bitcoin reserve, purchasing approximately $5 million in bitcoin through an exchange-traded fund.

At the same time, the Texas State Securities Board has been one of the most aggressive state-level enforcers in the digital asset space, entering more than 50 administrative orders against fraudulent or unregistered crypto offerings since 2017 — the first such state enforcement action in the country. Texas thus occupies a distinct position: welcoming to compliant operators, hostile to fraud, and increasingly sophisticated in its regulatory architecture.

## Virtual Currency Statutory Framework

### Business & Commerce Code Chapter 12

House Bill 4474, enacted during the 87th Legislature and effective September 1, 2021, created [Chapter 12 of the Texas Business & Commerce Code &#x2197;](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/BC/htm/BC.12.htm), titled "Virtual Currency." The bill was authored by Rep. Tan Parker with bipartisan co-authors and sponsored in the Senate by Sen. Bryan Hughes. _See_ [HB 4474 Bill Analysis &#x2197;](https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/87R/analysis/html/HB04474E.htm).

[Section 12.001 &#x2197;](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/BC/htm/BC.12.htm#12.001) defines "virtual currency" as a digital representation of value that functions as a medium of exchange, unit of account, or store of value and is not legal tender. The definition excludes merchant rewards program value and digital representations used solely within online games.

[Section 12.003 &#x2197;](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/BC/htm/BC.12.htm#12.003) establishes property rights in virtual currency. A purchaser acquires all rights the transferor had or had power to transfer. Critically, a "qualifying purchaser" — one who obtains control for value and without notice of adverse claims — takes free of adverse claims, whether framed in conversion, replevin, constructive trust, equitable lien, or other theory. Filing a UCC financing statement under Chapter 9 does not constitute notice of an adverse claim.

[Section 12.004 &#x2197;](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/BC/htm/BC.12.htm#12.004) defines "control" of virtual currency. A person has control if the virtual currency or its system gives that person (A) the power to derive substantially all the benefit, (B) the exclusive power to prevent others from deriving substantially all the benefit, and (C) the exclusive power to transfer control — and the person can be readily identified as having those powers.

### UCC Secured Transactions Amendments

HB 4474 simultaneously amended [Chapter 9 (Secured Transactions) &#x2197;](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/BC/htm/BC.9.htm) to integrate virtual currency into the state's commercial lending framework. Virtual currency was added to the UCC definitions at Section 9.102, and a new Section 9.1071 addresses control of virtual currency for secured transaction purposes. Security interests in virtual currency may be perfected either by filing a UCC financing statement or by obtaining control under Section 12.004. This framework enables virtual currency to serve as collateral in secured lending — a significant practical development for the industry.

Texas has not yet adopted the Uniform Law Commission's 2022 UCC amendments (which include a national model "Article 12 — Controllable Electronic Records"), though the Texas Blockchain Council lists updating Chapter 12 to align with the national model as a policy priority.

### Unclaimed Property

Senate Bill 1244, enacted during the 89th Legislature and effective September 1, 2025, updated the Texas Property Code to include virtual currency within the state's unclaimed property framework. Holders with full control of private keys must report and deliver virtual currency in its native form, and the Comptroller is authorized to contract with custodians for safekeeping.

## Money Transmission

### The Money Services Modernization Act (Chapter 152)

Senate Bill 895, enacted during the 88th Legislature and effective September 1, 2023, repealed the former Money Services Act ([Texas Finance Code Chapter 151 &#x2197;](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/FI/htm/FI.151.htm)) and replaced it with the Money Services Modernization Act, codified at [Texas Finance Code Chapter 152 &#x2197;](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/FI/htm/FI.152.htm). Any current analysis of Texas money transmission requirements must reference Chapter 152, not the repealed Chapter 151.

The pivotal provision for cryptocurrency businesses is [Section 152.003(19) &#x2197;](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/FI/htm/FI.152.htm#152.003), which defines "money or monetary value" to explicitly include qualifying stablecoins — those that are (A) pegged to a sovereign currency, (B) fully backed by assets held in reserve, and (C) grant the holder a right to redeem for sovereign currency. Other virtual currencies, including Bitcoin and Ether, are expressly excluded from the definition.

The practical effect: exchanging cryptocurrency for sovereign currency through a third-party exchanger generally constitutes money transmission requiring a license. Direct peer-to-peer exchanges and pure crypto-to-crypto exchanges generally do not. Software and protocol developers that never take custody of funds are typically not engaged in money transmission.

License applications are filed through NMLS with a $10,000 filing fee. Net worth requirements are tiered: $100,000 minimum (or 3% of total assets up to $100 million), scaling upward. Security requirements range from $100,000 to $500,000 depending on the tangible net worth ratio. Virtual currency applicants must submit a third-party security audit of their computer systems and may not count virtual currency holdings as permissible investments.

### Supervisory Memorandum 1037

The Texas Department of Banking has issued three versions of [Supervisory Memorandum 1037 &#x2197;](https://www.dob.texas.gov/public/uploads/files/consumer-information/sm1037.pdf), its primary guidance on virtual currency and money transmission:

* **April 2014 (original):** Texas became the first state to issue formal guidance on cryptocurrency and money transmission, establishing that cryptocurrency is not "money" under the Money Services Act.
* **January 2019 (amended):** Addressed stablecoins specifically, treating sovereign-backed stablecoins as "monetary value" while maintaining the exclusion for decentralized cryptocurrencies.
* **January 2024 (revised):** Updated for the MSMA (Chapter 152), classifying qualifying stablecoins as "money or monetary value" and providing detailed analysis of when crypto-related activities constitute money transmission.

### Digital Asset Service Providers (Chapter 160)

Enacted in the wake of the FTX collapse, Senate Bill 770 (88th Legislature, 2023) created [Texas Finance Code Chapter 160 &#x2197;](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/FI/htm/FI.160.htm), imposing requirements on digital asset service providers with 500 or more Texas customers or $10 million or more in customer funds. The statute prohibits commingling of customer funds, requires separate or omnibus custody accounts, mandates annual proof-of-reserves reports with auditor attestation, and provides for quarterly customer transparency into their holdings. Violations can result in license suspension or revocation.

## Securities Regulation

### Texas State Securities Board Enforcement

The Texas State Securities Board has been among the most active state securities regulators in the cryptocurrency space. The TSSB applies the _Howey_ investment-contract test to determine whether digital asset offerings constitute securities under the Texas Securities Act. The Board's Director of Enforcement, Joseph Rotunda, filed an expert report at the State Office of Administrative Hearings articulating this framework, and the Board takes the position that tokens sold in ICOs are securities requiring registration of both the securities and the selling agents.

On December 20, 2017, the TSSB entered an emergency cease-and-desist order against [USI-Tech &#x2197;](https://www.ssb.texas.gov/news-publications/usi-tech-limited), making Texas the first state securities regulator to enter an enforcement order against a cryptocurrency firm. Since then, the Commissioner has entered more than 50 administrative orders against crypto-related entities.

Notable enforcement actions include:

* **BitConnect (ENF-18-CDO-1754, 2018):** Emergency order against the $4.1 billion Ponzi scheme, whose token value collapsed following the Texas order and similar actions from other regulators.
* **2018 ICO Sweep:** Sixteen enforcement actions in a single year, targeting fraudulent mining schemes (BTCRUSH, Mintage Mining), cloud mining fraud, and unregistered token offerings.
* **BlockFi (2022):** Part of a $100 million multi-state settlement over unregistered interest-bearing crypto accounts.
* **Nexo (ENF-23-CDO-1871, 2023):** $22.5 million settlement over unregistered crypto lending products.
* **Sand Vegas Casino Club / Slotie NFT (2022):** Among the first state-level NFT enforcement actions in the country, targeting casino-themed NFT projects offering unregistered profit-sharing arrangements.
* **Apertum/DAO1 (ENF-23-CDO-1879, 2023; dismissed 2025):** Initially challenged as an unregistered security, the TSSB dismissed the action in July 2025, confirming that neither the token nor the DAO1 DeFi platform constituted an investment contract — a notable early example of a state regulator formally clearing a DeFi project.

The TSSB also publishes investor alerts on its [cryptocurrency scams resource page &#x2197;](https://www.ssb.texas.gov/cryptocurrency-scams), including warnings about BitConnect refund scams, pig butchering schemes, and impersonation fraud.

## Cryptocurrency Mining

### Texas as a Mining Hub

Texas has become one of the world's largest cryptocurrency mining jurisdictions, driven by several structural advantages: a deregulated energy market administered by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), some of the cheapest utility-scale solar in the country (approximately 2.8 cents per kilowatt-hour), abundant wind energy, no state income tax, and vocal political support from Governor Greg Abbott, Senator Ted Cruz, and the Texas Blockchain Council.

The state hosts approximately 27 to 40 mining facilities consuming an estimated 3,200 megawatts total. Major operations include:

* **Riot Platforms:** Rockdale facility (750 MW) and Corsicana facility (planned 1 GW, with 400 MW Phase 1 energized and 600 MW Phase 2 under evaluation for potential AI/HPC conversion). Riot's deployed hashrate reached 31.5 EH/s, and the company earned $71.2 million in ERCOT demand response credits in 2023 alone — including a single-month record of $31.7 million in August 2023.
* **Marathon Digital:** Granbury facility (300 MW) and a 114 MW wind-powered behind-the-meter operation in Hansford County.
* **Core Scientific:** Facilities in Denton (125 MW, expandable to 300 MW) and Pecos (71 MW, expandable to 234 MW), with the company headquartered in Austin and pivoting significant capacity toward a $6.1 billion AI data center campus.
* **Bitdeer:** Rockdale facility (563 MW) with a 100 MW hydro-cooling conversion completed.

### Grid Participation and Energy Policy

Miners participate in ERCOT's grid management through several mechanisms. The Large Flexible Load program (requiring 75 MW or greater capacity) requires registration and allows ERCOT to monitor and manage large energy consumers. The Four Coincident Peak (4CP) program provides transmission cost reductions for loads that curtail during the four highest-demand intervals each summer. Miners also provide ancillary services and earn demand response credits by voluntarily shutting down during grid stress events.

House Bill 591 (88th Legislature, 2023), signed by the Governor and passed 141-1, created a severance tax exemption for natural gas that would otherwise be flared but is instead diverted to on-site Bitcoin mining operations — directly incentivizing miners to reduce methane emissions.

Senate Bill 1929 (88th Legislature, 2023) and subsequent SB 6 (89th Legislature, 2025) imposed registration requirements on large cryptocurrency loads. Facilities meeting the 75 MW threshold must register with ERCOT, report power demand data, and — under SB 6 — maintain remote disconnect capability and pay a $100,000 application fee. Penalties for noncompliance reach $25,000 per day.

### Community Concerns

Mining operations have generated significant community opposition in some areas. In Granbury (Hood County), residents near Marathon Digital's 300 MW facility reported health effects from sustained industrial noise, including migraines, hearing damage, and sleep disruption — prompting an [Earthjustice nuisance lawsuit &#x2197;](https://earthjustice.org/press/2024/granbury-residents-sue-local-bitcoin-mine-over-health-threatening-noise-pollution) filed in 2024. In Navarro County, the county commissioners' court denied Riot Platforms a reinvestment zone designation for its Corsicana expansion in March 2025. Local noise and zoning ordinances vary significantly — Texas counties generally have less zoning authority than incorporated cities, creating regulatory gaps that some communities have attempted to address through incorporation votes or county-level ordinances.

## Banking and Custody

On June 10, 2021, the Texas Department of Banking issued [Industry Notice 2021-03 &#x2197;](https://www.dob.texas.gov/public/uploads/files/news/Industrynotices/in2021-03.pdf), clarifying that authority for Texas state-chartered banks to provide virtual currency custody services already exists under [Texas Finance Code Section 32.001 &#x2197;](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/FI/htm/FI.32.htm#32.001). Banks may custody virtual currency in a non-fiduciary capacity (acting as bailee, with the customer retaining legal title) or in a fiduciary capacity (requiring trust powers and potentially a charter amendment).

The Department of Banking has also been active in enforcement. Following FTX's collapse in November 2022, the Department issued an emergency cease-and-desist order and entered a consent order against FTX US in December 2022 for unlicensed money transmission. The Department has entered at least 14 consent orders against crypto-related entities since 2020, including actions against BlockFi, Bittrex, Genesis Global Capital, Nexo, Blockchain.com, and Kraken. _See_ [Texas Department of Banking Enforcement Orders &#x2197;](https://www.dob.texas.gov/laws-regulations/enforcement-orders).

In a notable corporate development, Coinbase Global, Inc. reincorporated from Delaware to Texas in November 2025, reflecting the state's growing attractiveness to major crypto businesses.

## Blockchain and Smart Contracts

Texas does not yet have a statute explicitly recognizing blockchain records or smart contracts by name. However, [Business & Commerce Code Chapter 322 &#x2197;](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/BC/htm/BC.322.htm) — Texas's version of the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act — provides broad definitions of "electronic record," "electronic signature," and "automated transaction" that are generally understood to encompass blockchain-based records, signatures, and smart contract execution. Section 322.007 provides that a record or signature may not be denied legal effect or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form, and Section 322.014 recognizes that contracts may be formed by the interaction of electronic agents without human review.

Two legislative efforts to provide explicit blockchain recognition have passed the Texas House but failed in the Senate:

* **HB 3768 (88th Legislature, 2023):** Would have defined "digital asset," "distributed ledger technology," and "smart contract" in the Business Organizations Code; provided that blockchain can satisfy signature and writing requirements; established that blockchain-based records and smart contracts cannot be excluded as evidence solely due to their technological form; and created a new entity type for Decentralized Unincorporated Associations. The bill passed the House unanimously (140-0) on May 12, 2023, but died in the Senate Business & Commerce Committee.

* **HB 4518 (89th Legislature, 2025):** A successor bill establishing Decentralized Unincorporated Nonprofit Associations (DUNAs) with governance through smart contracts and distributed ledger technology. Passed the House 118-14 on May 15, 2025, but was left pending in the Senate Business & Commerce Committee on May 23, 2025.

Both bills indicate strong House support for explicit blockchain recognition, and practitioners should watch for renewed efforts in the 90th Legislature (2027).

## Strategic Bitcoin Reserve

Senate Bill 21, authored by Sen. Charles Schwertner and signed by Governor Abbott on June 20, 2025, established the [Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve &#x2197;](https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB21) as a special fund outside the state treasury, administered by the Comptroller of Public Accounts.

The reserve may hold bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency with an average market capitalization of at least $500 billion over the most recent 24-month period — a threshold currently met only by Bitcoin. Funding sources include legislative appropriations, investment proceeds, dedicated revenue streams, forks and airdrops from held assets, and voluntary cryptocurrency donations. A five-member advisory committee (the Comptroller, one investment advisory board member, and three crypto investment experts) oversees the fund, and biennial reports on holdings and valuation are required.

The Legislature initially appropriated $10 million. Texas purchased approximately $5 million in bitcoin through an exchange-traded fund in November 2025, becoming the first state to actually fund a strategic cryptocurrency reserve. A companion bill, HB 4488, shields the reserve from periodic treasury fund sweeps.

In January 2026, legislation was filed to expand the reserve's eligibility to include Ethereum and Solana by lowering the market capitalization threshold — though as of February 2026 that proposal remains pending.

## Legislative Developments

Texas's crypto-related legislation has accelerated significantly across the last three legislative sessions:

**87th Legislature (2021):**

* **HB 4474** — Created Business & Commerce Code Chapter 12 (Virtual Currency) and amended Chapter 9 (Secured Transactions). Signed by the Governor; effective September 1, 2021.
* **HB 1576** — Established a 16-member Blockchain Work Group tasked with developing a master plan for expanding the blockchain industry in Texas. Signed by the Governor; effective September 1, 2021.

**88th Legislature (2023):**

* **SB 895** — Money Services Modernization Act, replacing Chapter 151 with Chapter 152 and explicitly addressing stablecoins. Effective September 1, 2023.
* **SB 770** — Digital Asset Service Provider requirements (Chapter 160), including proof-of-reserves and anti-commingling. Effective September 1, 2023.
* **HB 591** — Severance tax exemption for flared gas diverted to Bitcoin mining. Passed 141-1; effective September 1, 2023.
* **SB 1929** — ERCOT registration requirements for large flexible loads including crypto miners. Effective September 1, 2023.
* **SB 1751** — Would have capped miner participation in demand response programs and abolished mining tax abatements. Passed the Senate unanimously but died in the House State Affairs Committee.
* **HB 3768** — Blockchain definitions, smart contract recognition, and decentralized entity framework. Passed the House 140-0; died in the Senate.

**89th Legislature (2025):**

* **SB 21** — Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act. Signed June 20, 2025; effective immediately.
* **HB 4488** — Companion bill protecting the Bitcoin reserve from treasury fund sweeps. Effective immediately.
* **SB 1244** — Unclaimed property provisions for virtual currency. Effective September 1, 2025.
* **SB 6** — Grid emergency powers, remote disconnect requirements for large loads, $100,000 application fee. Signed; effective June 2025.
* **HB 4518** — DUNAs (Decentralized Unincorporated Nonprofit Associations). Passed the House 118-14; died in the Senate.

Key legislators driving Texas's crypto framework include Rep. Tan Parker (author of HB 4474 and HB 1576, now a state Senator), Sen. Charles Schwertner (SB 21), and Sen. Bryan Hughes (Senate sponsor of HB 4474).

## Enforcement Actions

Texas enforcement against crypto-related misconduct comes from three primary sources:

**Texas State Securities Board:** More than 50 administrative orders since December 2017, when USI-Tech became the first crypto enforcement action by any state securities regulator. The TSSB's focus has been on fraudulent ICOs, unregistered token offerings, cloud mining fraud, Ponzi-style lending platforms (BitConnect, Celsius), unregistered interest-bearing accounts (BlockFi, Nexo), and — more recently — NFT-based securities (Sand Vegas Casino Club, Slotie NFT). The Board publishes all enforcement orders and maintains active investor education resources. _See_ [TSSB Enforcement Actions &#x2197;](https://www.ssb.texas.gov/texas-securities-act-background/enforcement-actions).

**Texas Department of Banking:** At least 14 consent orders against crypto entities since 2020, primarily for operating without required money transmission licenses. The FTX US emergency order (November 2022) and consent order (December 2022) were among the swiftest state-level responses to the FTX collapse.

**Attorney General:** The Texas Attorney General led an 18-state coalition lawsuit against the SEC in November 2024, challenging federal authority to regulate digital assets — positioning Texas as opposing federal crypto overreach. The Legislature also enacted SB 1498 (89th Legislature, 2025), expanding digital asset forfeiture authority.

## Practical Considerations

**Money transmission licensing.** Businesses exchanging cryptocurrency for fiat currency through a custodial platform generally need a Texas money transmission license under Chapter 152. Pure crypto-to-crypto exchanges and non-custodial software providers are generally exempt. Stablecoin transactions receive particular scrutiny. Applications go through NMLS; expect a $10,000 filing fee, net worth requirements starting at $100,000, and a mandatory third-party security audit.

**Securities compliance.** Token offerings to Texas residents are likely securities requiring registration or an exemption. The TSSB has shown no hesitation in pursuing emergency cease-and-desist orders, and its enforcement reach extends to out-of-state promoters marketing to Texas investors. The Apertum/DAO1 dismissal (2025) suggests some DeFi protocols may fall outside the investment-contract framework, but practitioners should not rely on that outcome as a blanket safe harbor.

**Mining operations.** Facilities at or above 75 MW must register with ERCOT and comply with SB 6's remote disconnect and reporting requirements ($100,000 application fee; $25,000/day noncompliance penalty). Local permitting varies significantly — operators should confirm county and municipal noise ordinances, zoning requirements, and tax abatement eligibility before committing to a site. Community relations have become a material risk factor, particularly in rural counties with limited regulatory infrastructure.

**Banking and custody.** Texas state-chartered banks have clear authority to custody virtual currency under Industry Notice 2021-03. Trust company charters provide an alternative path. Digital asset service providers meeting the Chapter 160 thresholds (500+ Texas customers or $10M+ in customer assets) must comply with proof-of-reserves, anti-commingling, and transparency requirements.
