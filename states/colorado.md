# 2.06 - Colorado

## Overview

Colorado has been one of the more ambitious U.S. states in engaging with cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Governor Jared Polis — a co-founder of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus during his time in the U.S. House — signed the Colorado Digital Token Act in 2019, making the state one of the first to create a state-level securities exemption for utility tokens. Colorado became the first state to accept cryptocurrency for tax payments in 2022. And the state hosts ETHDenver, the largest and longest-running Ethereum hackathon and conference in the world.

The record is also one of pragmatic correction. The Digital Token Act was repealed in 2024 after five years without a single publicly documented filing — a clean illustration of the limits of state-level securities exemptions that do not address federal law. In its place, Colorado has pursued more targeted regulation: a 2023 adoption of UCC Article 12 for digital asset property rights, a 2025 modernization of the money transmission framework, and a 2025 statute regulating cryptocurrency ATM kiosks in response to a surge in consumer fraud.

The state's enforcement posture has been consistently aggressive against fraud. The Division of Securities participated in Operation Cryptosweep in 2018, entering 18 cease-and-desist orders against ICOs. More recently, the INDXcoin case (2024-2025) resulted in a $3.34 million fraud judgment and 40 criminal counts against a Denver pastor who sold a worthless token to members of his congregation.

## The Colorado Digital Token Act (2019-2024)

### Origins

The Digital Token Act emerged from the Colorado Council for the Advancement of Blockchain Technology Use, a 16-member body created by Governor John Hickenlooper in June 2018 and housed within the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade (OEDIT). The Council — which included blockchain entrepreneurs, state regulators, and legal professionals — engaged more than 100 volunteers across working groups and produced a [final report &#x2197;](https://oedit.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/blockchainreport_final_2-6-2019.pdf) in February 2019 identifying eight key problem areas, including securities regulatory clarity around token sales and money transmission rules for cryptocurrency.

The Council's work followed a difficult 2018 legislative session in which several crypto-related bills narrowly failed. [HB 18-1426 &#x2197;](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb18-1426), which would have exempted virtual currencies from the Money Transmitters Act, passed the House 57-8 but failed on Senate Third Reading 18-17. A companion bill, [SB 18-277 &#x2197;](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb18-277), failed 15-20. A separate bill that would have required cryptocurrency dealers to obtain money transmitter licenses, [HB 18-1220 &#x2197;](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb18-1220), passed the House but was indefinitely postponed in the Senate.

### Enactment: SB 19-023

[Senate Bill 19-023 &#x2197;](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb19-023), the "Cryptocurrency Exemption Colorado Digital Token Act," was introduced on January 4, 2019. Prime sponsors were Sen. Stephen Fenberg (D) and Sen. Jack Tate (R) in the Senate, and Rep. Tracy Kraft-Tharp (D) and Rep. Hugh McKean (R) in the House, with 18 bipartisan co-sponsors. The bill passed unanimously in both chambers — 32-0 in the Senate and 62-0 in the House — and was signed by Governor Polis on March 8, 2019. It took effect August 2, 2019 and was codified at [Colo. Rev. Stat. Section 11-51-308.7 &#x2197;](https://law.justia.com/codes/colorado/title-11/securities/securities/article-51/part-3/section-11-51-308-7/).

### Statutory Framework

The Act created a securities registration exemption under the Colorado Securities Act for offers and sales of "digital tokens" meeting specific conditions. The exemption was not self-executing — it required the Securities Commissioner to promulgate implementing rules before any issuer could rely on it.

**Definition of "digital token."** The Act defined a digital token as a digital unit meeting three cumulative criteria: (1) created in response to transaction verification on a digital ledger, by deploying code to a blockchain network, or a combination of both; (2) recorded in a digital ledger or database that is chronological, consensus-based, decentralized, and mathematically verified; and (3) capable of being traded or transferred between persons without an intermediary or custodian of value.

**Exemption requirements.** An offer or sale of a digital token was exempt from securities registration only if all of the following conditions were met:

* The issuer filed **Form DT-1** (notice of intent) with the Securities Commissioner before any offer or sale.
* The **primary purpose** of the digital token was "consumptive" — defined as the ability to provide or receive goods, services, or content.
* The issuer **marketed the token for consumptive use** and did **not** market it for speculative or investment purposes.
* If the consumptive purpose was available at the time of sale, the exemption applied directly. If the consumptive purpose was **not yet available**, three additional conditions applied: (a) the consumptive purpose had to become available **within 180 days** of sale; (b) the initial buyer was **prohibited from reselling or transferring** the token until the consumptive purpose became available; and (c) the initial buyer had to provide a **knowing and clear acknowledgment** that the purchase was for consumptive, not investment, purposes.
* The issuer complied with all Commissioner rules.

A separate licensing exemption (Form DT-2) was available under [Rule 3.35 &#x2197;](https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/colorado/3-CCR-704-1-51-3.35) for persons effecting purchases, sales, or transfers of qualifying digital tokens.

**Commissioner's rules.** The Securities Commissioner adopted three implementing regulations under [3 CCR 704-1 &#x2197;](https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/colorado/3-CCR-704-1-51-3.34), effective August 2, 2019:

* **Rule 3.34** — Registration exemption: filing fees, Form DT-1 requirements, and Commissioner review procedures.
* **Rule 3.35** — Licensing exemption: Form DT-2 requirements.
* **Rule 3.36** — Books and records: five-year retention requirement for all digital token transactions; Commissioner examination authority without advance notice.

Issuers were required to file amendments within 30 days of discovering material mistakes or changes in previously submitted filings.

### Why the Act Failed

Despite its ambitious design and unanimous legislative support, **no project is publicly known to have filed under the Colorado Digital Token Act.** The fundamental problem was structural: the Act provided only a state-level exemption from Colorado securities registration. It did nothing to address federal securities law. An issuer relying on the Colorado exemption still needed to comply with SEC registration requirements or qualify for a federal exemption such as Regulation D — which, as a practical matter, rendered the state exemption largely superfluous. Legal commentary at the time of enactment observed that the Act provided "primarily symbolic" relief and that "those in the crypto community seeking a full-bodied exemption from securities regulation will not find it." _See_ [ZwillGen, "Colorado Bill Seeks to Offer ICOs an Exemption" &#x2197;](https://www.zwillgen.com/general/colorado-bill-seeks-offer-icos-exemption-securities-regulations/); [Hunton Andrews Kurth, "Colorado Enacts Digital Token Act" &#x2197;](https://www.hunton.com/blockchain-legal-resource/colorado-enacts-digital-token-act).

### Repeal: SB 24-180

[Senate Bill 24-180 &#x2197;](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb24-180) repealed the Digital Token Act effective August 7, 2024. Notably, Sen. Stephen Fenberg — an original prime sponsor of SB 19-023 in 2019 — co-sponsored the repeal. The bill passed 35-0 in the Senate and 59-2 in the House. The repeal reflected a legislative consensus that the Act had not achieved its objectives.

### Comparison to Wyoming

Wyoming's utility token exemption ([Wyo. Stat. Section 34-29-106 &#x2197;](https://law.justia.com/codes/wyoming/2022/title-34/chapter-29/section-34-29-106/)) took a broader approach: it exempted qualifying "open blockchain tokens" from both securities registration and money transmission laws, and classified them as intangible personal property. Wyoming's exemption remains in force. Colorado's approach was narrower (securities only) and more prescriptive (180-day window, transfer lock-up, buyer acknowledgment). Both share the same fundamental limitation — neither addresses federal securities law — but Wyoming's combined securities-and-money-transmission exemption provided marginally more practical value.

## Securities Regulation and Enforcement

The Colorado Division of Securities, within the Department of Regulatory Agencies (DORA), administers the Colorado Securities Act. The Securities Commissioner applies the _Howey_ investment-contract test to determine whether digital asset offerings constitute securities.

### Operation Cryptosweep (2018)

In May 2018, Securities Commissioner Gerald Rome convened an ICO Task Force to investigate potentially fraudulent cryptocurrency activity. By November 2018, Commissioner Rome had entered **18 cease-and-desist orders** against ICOs for unregistered securities offerings as part of NASAA's [Operation Cryptosweep &#x2197;](https://www.nasaa.org/45121/state-and-provincial-securities-regulators-conduct-coordinated-international-crypto-crackdown-2/) — a coordinated enforcement action involving more than 40 jurisdictions. Targets included BitConnect Ltd., Bitcoin Investments Ltd. (d/b/a DB Capital), PinkDate (an anonymously-operated escorting service ICO promising 50% profit dividends), Prisma (a lending platform claiming 27% returns), and multiple other offerings.

### Nexo Settlement (2023)

On March 17, 2023, the Division of Securities entered a [consent order against Nexo Capital Inc. &#x2197;](https://dora.colorado.gov/press-release/colorado-division-of-securities-joins-225-million-multistate-securities-settlement) as part of a $22.5 million multistate settlement. The allegation was that Nexo's Earn Interest Product — which promised investors interest on cryptocurrency deposits — constituted an unregistered security. Nexo agreed to stop offering the product in Colorado and cease paying interest on existing accounts by April 1, 2023. The SEC separately fined Nexo $22.5 million, bringing the combined penalty to $45 million.

### INDXcoin / Regalado Fraud (2024-2025)

The most significant recent Colorado crypto enforcement action involved INDXcoin, a token created by Denver pastor Eligio "Eli" Regalado Jr. and his wife Kaitlyn Regalado. From June 2022 to April 2023, the Regalados sold INDXcoin to more than 300 members of the Christian community through the "Kingdom Wealth Exchange," raising nearly $3.4 million. An auditor they hired gave the platform a security score of 0 out of 10 — which was never disclosed to investors. The exchange collapsed after a single day of trading.

On January 16, 2024, Securities Commissioner Tung Chan [filed civil fraud charges &#x2197;](https://securities.colorado.gov/press-release/press-release-colorado-securities-commissioner-files-complaint-against-alleged). On April 15, 2025, Denver District Court granted summary judgment that INDXcoin met the definition of a security. After a three-day bench trial in May 2025, Judge Heidi L. Kutcher [entered judgment of $3,339,422.15 &#x2197;](https://securities.colorado.gov/press-release/press-release-denver-district-court-rules-indxcoin-cryptocurrency-scheme-was-a-fraud) against all defendants. Separately, a Denver grand jury criminally indicted the Regalados on 40 counts in July 2025.

### Bitcoin ATM Scam Warnings (2024)

On December 16, 2024, Commissioner Chan issued a [public warning &#x2197;](https://securities.colorado.gov/press-release/press-release-colorado-securities-commissioner-warns-of-massive-increase-in-scams) about a "massive increase in scams leveraging Bitcoin ATMs." The FTC had reported over $110 million in Bitcoin ATM scam losses nationally in 2023, a tenfold increase since 2020. This enforcement concern directly motivated the passage of SB 25-079, the Vending of Digital Assets Act.

## Money Transmission

### Statutory Framework

Colorado's money transmission statute is codified at [C.R.S. Title 11, Article 110 &#x2197;](https://law.justia.com/codes/colorado/title-11/money-transmitters/article-110/). On April 18, 2025, Governor Polis signed [HB 25-1201 &#x2197;](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb25-1201), the Money Transmission Modernization Act (MTMA), which repealed and reenacted Article 110 effective August 6, 2025. The MTMA is based on the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) model law.

### Application to Cryptocurrency

The Colorado Division of Banking issued its first interim guidance on cryptocurrency and money transmission on September 20, 2018, establishing that:

* Cryptocurrencies are not "money" or "legal tender" under Colorado law.
* Pure **crypto-to-crypto exchanges** do not require a money transmitter license.
* Licensing is required when an exchange (i) buys or sells cryptocurrency for fiat currency, (ii) allows customer-to-customer crypto transfers, and (iii) enables fiat transfer through the medium of cryptocurrency.

On December 18, 2025, the Division issued [updated guidance &#x2197;](https://banking.colorado.gov/sites/banking/files/documents/Interim_Guidance_Cryptocurrency_and_the_MTMA_Final_12.18.25.pdf) under the revised MTMA, addressing the treatment of payment stablecoins as "stored value" and the federal preemption implications of the GENIUS Act.

### Licensing Requirements

License applications are filed through NMLS. The filing fee is $7,500 (January-June) or $3,750 (July-December). Surety bond minimums are $250,000, scaling to $1,000,000 or more for higher volumes. Under the MTMA, net worth requirements are the greater of $100,000 or a tiered percentage: 3% of the first $100 million in total assets, 2% of $100 million to $1 billion, and 0.5% above $1 billion. Background checks and fingerprinting are required.

## Blockchain and Digital Assets

### State Records: SB 18-086 (2018)

[Senate Bill 18-086 &#x2197;](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb18-086), signed by Governor Hickenlooper on May 30, 2018, required state agencies — including the Governor's Office of Information Technology, the Department of State, and DORA — to consider using distributed ledger technology and encryption techniques to protect confidential state records. The bill also encouraged higher education institutions to include blockchain in curricula; the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs received $1.8 million for blockchain-related scholarships and research.

### UCC Article 12: SB 23-090 (2023)

[Senate Bill 23-090 &#x2197;](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb23-090), effective August 7, 2023, adopted the Uniform Law Commission's 2022 amendments to the Uniform Commercial Code, creating new Article 12 governing "controllable electronic records." The amendments address transfer of property rights in intangible digital assets (including virtual currencies and NFTs), security interests in controllable accounts and controllable payment intangibles, and updated definitions throughout Articles 1, 9, and 12. Colorado was among the first wave of approximately 24 states to adopt these amendments.

### Electronic Transactions

Colorado's adoption of the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act ([C.R.S. Section 24-71.3-107 &#x2197;](https://law.justia.com/codes/colorado/title-24/electronic-transactions/article-71-3/section-24-71-3-107/)) provides that records and signatures may not be denied legal effect or enforceability solely because they are in electronic form. While not blockchain-specific, this framework provides the legal basis under which blockchain-based records and signatures may be recognized as legally valid. Colorado has not enacted a dedicated blockchain records recognition or smart contract enforceability statute comparable to those in Arizona, Tennessee, or Wyoming.

## Banking and Custody

Colorado does not have a special-purpose depository institution charter for digital assets comparable to Wyoming's SPDI. However, existing trust company charters under [C.R.S. Title 11, Article 109 &#x2197;](https://law.justia.com/codes/colorado/title-11/trust-companies/article-109/) have been used for crypto custody. Etana Custody, Inc., a Colorado-chartered trust company, provided cryptocurrency custody services before the Division of Banking issued a cease-and-desist order on August 22, 2025, followed by a suspension order on September 19, 2025, and a liquidation and receivership order on November 7, 2025, due to financial reporting and capitalization failures.

## Vending of Digital Assets Act (2025)

[Senate Bill 25-079 &#x2197;](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb25-079), signed by Governor Polis on June 2, 2025, created the Colorado Vending of Digital Assets Act, effective January 1, 2026. The statute regulates virtual currency kiosks (cryptocurrency ATMs) and requires:

* Clear, conspicuous disclosures at the point of transaction warning about fraud risk.
* Both printed and electronic receipts including transaction hashes, wallet addresses, and operator contact information.
* Daily transaction limits: **$2,000 for new customers** (less than 7 days of transaction history) and **$10,500 for existing customers**.
* A refund process for first-time customers defrauded in transactions involving wallets or exchanges outside the United States, provided the customer reports the fraud within 60 days.

The bill was motivated by FTC data showing over $110 million in national Bitcoin ATM scam losses in 2023 — a tenfold increase since 2020 — and received public support from AARP Colorado.

## State Leadership and Crypto Initiatives

### Governor Polis

Before becoming Governor, Jared Polis served as a U.S. Representative (CO-2, 2009-2019) and co-founded the Congressional Blockchain Caucus. He introduced the Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act of 2017 with Rep. David Schweikert (R-AZ), which would have exempted consumer cryptocurrency purchases under $600 from reporting requirements. As Governor, Polis signed the Digital Token Act (2019), delivered a keynote at ETHDenver in February 2022, and continued the blockchain program initiated by the Blockchain Council by appointing Thaddeus Batt as Colorado's first blockchain solution architect within OEDIT.

### Cryptocurrency for State Payments

In September 2022, Colorado became the **first U.S. state to accept cryptocurrency for state tax payments**, implemented through PayPal's cryptocurrency processing. The program covers individual and business income tax, sales and use tax, withholding tax, severance tax, and excise fuel tax. The state does not hold cryptocurrency — all payments are immediately converted to U.S. dollars, with a service fee of $1 plus 1.83%.

Adoption has been minimal. Through December 2024: 8 payments totaling $16,426 in 2022 (September-December), 22 payments totaling $23,241 in 2023, and 48 payments totaling $17,544 in 2024 — approximately **$57,211 total**, representing roughly 0.0005% of the $11+ billion in income tax collected over that period. _See_ [Colorado Newsline, "Cryptocurrency Tax Revenue Negligible" &#x2197;](https://coloradonewsline.com/briefs/cryptocurrency-tax-revenue-colorado/).

The Division of Motor Vehicles also began accepting cryptocurrency through PayPal for online transactions — including driver's license renewals and vehicle registration — in 2023. _See_ [Colorado DMV Cryptocurrency &#x2197;](https://dmv.colorado.gov/cryptocurrency).

## Legislative Developments

Colorado's crypto-related legislation spans four legislative sessions:

* **SB 25-079** — Vending of Digital Assets Act (Bitcoin ATM regulation). Signed June 2, 2025.

## Industry Presence

**ETHDenver** is the longest-standing and largest Ethereum hackathon and conference in the world, held annually in Denver. The 2024 event drew approximately 20,000 attendees; 2025 drew approximately 25,000. Governor Polis has delivered keynote addresses, and the event is a significant contributor to Colorado's crypto ecosystem. _See_ [ETHDenver &#x2197;](https://ethdenver.com/).

Colorado-based crypto companies include the **Electric Coin Company** (developer of the Zcash privacy cryptocurrency, headquartered in Broomfield), **SALT Lending** (pioneer of crypto-backed lending since 2016), **Compass Mining** (headquartered in Denver, operating a 50,000-square-foot service center), and **Crusoe Energy** (Denver-based, specializing in using stranded natural gas to power mining operations). Solar-powered mining operations, including those by Aspen Creek Digital Corporation, have also been established in western Colorado.

## Practical Considerations

**Token offerings.** The Digital Token Act is no longer available. Any offer or sale of digital tokens to Colorado residents that constitutes a security must be registered under the Colorado Securities Act or qualify for an applicable exemption. Federal compliance (SEC registration or a Regulation D exemption) remains required regardless.

**Money transmission.** Under the MTMA (effective August 2025), businesses exchanging cryptocurrency for fiat currency through a custodial platform generally need a Colorado money transmitter license. Pure crypto-to-crypto exchanges are generally exempt because cryptocurrency is not "money" under the statute. Stablecoin transactions receive particular scrutiny. Applications are filed through NMLS with a $7,500 fee and $250,000 minimum bond.

**Securities enforcement.** The Division of Securities has demonstrated a consistent willingness to pursue emergency cease-and-desist orders against fraudulent crypto offerings, including out-of-state promoters marketing to Colorado investors. The INDXcoin case (2024-2025) confirms that the Commissioner will pursue both civil and criminal remedies.

**Cryptocurrency ATMs.** Operators of virtual currency kiosks in Colorado must comply with the Vending of Digital Assets Act (effective January 1, 2026), including transaction limits, disclosure requirements, and fraud refund provisions.
