# 2.26 - Montana

## Overview

Montana has emerged as one of the most crypto-friendly states in the country, distinguished by a combination found nowhere else: it is the only U.S. state with no state-level money transmitter licensing requirement, it has no sales tax, and it has enacted five significant digital asset bills across three legislative sessions. The state's libertarian-leaning policy philosophy — minimal regulatory friction, individual rights protections, and targeted enforcement rather than broad licensing — has produced a framework that is unusually favorable to cryptocurrency businesses and miners alike.

The legislative arc runs from experimentation to comprehensiveness. In 2019, Montana was among the first states to create a utility token securities exemption (HB 584), alongside Wyoming and Colorado. In 2023, SB 178 classified digital assets as personal property, established a right to mine, and prohibited discriminatory taxation of crypto payments. And in 2025, the Financial Freedom and Innovation Act (SB 265) created one of the nation's first network token certification pathways, banned state acceptance of central bank digital currencies, and protected self-custody and staking rights. Senator Daniel Zolnikov (R-Billings) has been the principal legislative architect of the 2023 and 2025 frameworks.

Montana's enforcement posture mirrors its regulatory philosophy: light on licensing, aggressive against fraud. The Commissioner of Securities and Insurance has entered cease-and-desist orders against crypto pyramid schemes, participated in multi-state enforcement actions, and pursued felony charges against perpetrators of crypto investment fraud targeting Montana residents.

## Utility Token Exemption (HB 584, 2019-2023)

House Bill 584, introduced by Rep. Shane Morigeau (D-Missoula), was signed by Governor Steve Bullock on May 8, 2019, and took effect July 1, 2019. The bill created a transactional exemption from state securities registration for "utility tokens," codified at [MCA § 30-10-105(23) &#x2197;](https://law.justia.com/codes/montana/title-30/chapter-10/part-1/section-30-10-105/). _See_ [HB 584 bill text &#x2197;](https://archive.legmt.gov/bills/2019/BillHtml/HB0584.htm).

The statute defined a utility token as a digital unit created on a blockchain, recorded in a decentralized and mathematically verified ledger, capable of peer-to-peer transfer without an intermediary, and exchangeable for goods, services, or content "without vesting the holder with any ownership interest or equity interest in the issuer." To qualify for the exemption, the token's purpose had to be "primarily consumptive," and the issuer could not market it for speculative or investment purposes. If the consumptive purpose was not available at sale, it had to become available within 180 days, and the initial buyer was prohibited from reselling until then and was required to provide a knowing acknowledgment of consumptive intent. Issuers were required to file a notice of intent with the Commissioner of Securities and Insurance before any offering. _See_ [ARM 6.10.307 &#x2197;](https://rules.mt.gov/gateway/RuleNo.asp?RN=6.10.307) (implementing rule, effective October 24, 2020).

**No project is publicly known to have filed under the HB 584 exemption.** The fundamental limitation — shared with Colorado's Digital Token Act — was that the state exemption did not address federal securities law. An issuer still needed to comply with SEC registration requirements or qualify for a federal exemption, rendering the state-level exemption largely academic. Montana's small population (approximately 1.1 million) further limited commercial viability. The Senate passed the bill 33-15.

The exemption terminated by its sunset clause on September 30, 2023, and was effectively replaced by SB 265's network token framework in 2025.

### Comparison to Wyoming and Colorado

Montana's approach was structurally similar to Colorado's (a securities registration exemption with a 180-day consumptive-purpose timeline) but differed from Wyoming's, which reclassified qualifying tokens as intangible personal property rather than creating a securities exemption. Wyoming's approach — codified at [W.S. § 34-29-106 &#x2197;](https://law.justia.com/codes/wyoming/title-34/chapter-29/article-1/section-34-29-106/) — included a money transmission exemption and no sunset provision. Wyoming's exemption remains in force. Both Montana and Colorado's original exemptions have expired or been repealed.

## Digital Asset Framework (SB 178, 2023)

[Senate Bill 178 &#x2197;](https://archive.legmt.gov/bills/2023/billhtml/SB0178.htm), sponsored by Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, was signed by Governor Greg Gianforte on May 2, 2023. The bill established four foundational protections:

**Digital assets as personal property.** SB 178 amended [MCA § 70-1-108 &#x2197;](https://law.justia.com/codes/montana/title-70/chapter-1/part-1/section-70-1-108/) to classify digital assets — defined as "cryptocurrencies, natively electronic assets, including stable coins and nonfungible tokens, and other digital-only assets that confer economic, proprietary, or access rights or powers" — as personal property.

**Right to mine.** The Public Service Commission may not establish rate classifications for digital asset mining that create unduly discriminatory rates. "Digital asset mining" is defined as the use of electricity to power a computer for the purpose of securing a blockchain network.

**Local government preemption.** Local governing bodies may not enact ordinances restricting the right to mine digital assets, including at private residences — a provision that effectively preempted Missoula County's 2019-2021 renewable energy mining ordinance (discussed below).

**No discriminatory taxation.** Digital assets used as a method of payment may not be subject to any additional tax, withholding, assessment, or charge by the state or local government based solely on the use of the digital asset as the method of payment.

## Financial Freedom and Innovation Act (SB 265, 2025)

[Senate Bill 265 &#x2197;](https://archive.legmt.gov/content/Sessions/69th/Contractor_index/CH0379.pdf), also sponsored by Sen. Zolnikov, is Montana's most comprehensive digital asset legislation. It passed the Senate 44-6 and the House 70-29, was signed by Governor Gianforte, and took effect October 1, 2025. _See_ [CSI announcement &#x2197;](https://csimt.gov/2025/10/07/montana-opens-the-door-to-digital-asset-innovation-with-financial-freedom-and-innovation-act/).

The Act introduces a **network token certification pathway**. Issuers of qualifying network tokens — digital assets that power decentralized services such as computing, data storage, and media streaming — may apply directly with the Commissioner of Securities and Insurance for certification. Certified tokens are exempt from traditional securities registration under MCA § 30-10-105. The aggregate of network tokens sold in any 12-month period may not exceed $250 million (adjusted annually by CPI).

Beyond network tokens, SB 265 establishes broader digital asset rights:

* **CBDC prohibition.** Montana governing authorities may not accept or require payment using central bank digital currencies.
* **Self-custody.** Individuals and businesses may freely use self-hosted wallets, operate blockchain nodes, develop blockchain software, and transfer digital assets.
* **Staking protection.** A business offering staking as a service may not be considered as offering a security or investment contract — one of the first explicit state-level protections of this kind.
* **Commissioner authority.** The CSI has clear authority to regulate the industry and prosecute fraudulent actors under the Act's certification framework.

Commissioner James Brown described SB 265 as providing "the certainty [entrepreneurs] need while ensuring Montanans are protected."

## Money Transmission

Montana is the **only U.S. state that does not require a state-level money transmitter license**. The Division of Banking and Financial Institutions does not regulate money transmitters, and no Montana Money Transmitters Act or equivalent statute exists. _See_ [Division of Banking — Money Transmitters &#x2197;](https://banking.mt.gov/moneytransmitters).

This means cryptocurrency exchanges, ATM operators, payment processors, and wallet providers operating in or from Montana face no state licensing, bonding, or examination requirements. In March 2023, the Division briefly requested business plans from money transmitters before withdrawing the request without explanation — an episode [analyzed by McDermott Will & Emery &#x2197;](https://www.mwe.com/insights/montana-pump-fakes-a-requirement-for-money-transmitters/) as a "pump fake" that ultimately reaffirmed the status quo.

Federal FinCEN registration under the Bank Secrecy Act remains fully applicable. All businesses operating as money services businesses must register with FinCEN, implement AML programs, and comply with OFAC sanctions regardless of Montana's state-level posture.

## Securities Regulation and Enforcement

The [Securities Act of Montana &#x2197;](https://law.justia.com/codes/montana/title-30/chapter-10/) (MCA Title 30, Chapter 10) is administered by the Commissioner of Securities and Insurance, who also serves as the State Auditor. The Commissioner applies the _Howey_ investment-contract test to determine whether digital asset offerings constitute securities.

Notable enforcement actions include:

* **Forsage (2021):** Cease-and-desist order against a Philippines-based Ethereum pyramid scheme targeting Montana residents. The SEC subsequently charged 11 individuals in the scheme. _See_ [CSI announcement &#x2197;](https://csimt.gov/2021/04/07/montana-regulator-issues-cease-and-desist-order-against-forsage-scam/).
* **YieldTrust.ai (2023):** Montana joined Texas and Alabama in a multi-state enforcement action against a fraudulent "quantum AI" crypto trading scheme, seeking $100,000 in fines. _See_ [CSI announcement &#x2197;](https://csimt.gov/2023/04/04/montana-commissioner-of-securities-joins-other-state-regulators-to-stop-fraudulent-artificial-intelligence-investment-scheme/).
* **Crypto investment fund fraud (2025):** Six felony counts — including elder exploitation and securities fraud — against an Idaho resident who defrauded elderly Montana investors through a fraudulent crypto fund exceeding $1 million.

Crypto ATM fraud has surged: $600,000 in losses reported since 2023, with 20 complaints totaling $3.1 million through September 2025. Commissioner Brown has signaled that crypto ATM regulation may be addressed in the 2027 legislative session. _See_ [CSI crypto ATM fraud advisory &#x2197;](https://csimt.gov/2025/11/04/crypto-atm-fraud-on-the-rise-nationally-prompting-montana-regulatory-push/).

## Cryptocurrency Mining

Montana's structural advantages for mining include abundant hydroelectric power from the Missouri River system, cold winters that reduce cooling costs, and available industrial infrastructure at former mill and power plant sites. Major operations have included Marathon Digital's 57 MW facility adjacent to the coal-fired Hardin Generating Station (subsequently scaled back after environmental criticism over a tenfold increase in CO2 emissions), a 20 MW hydroelectric-powered mine at the Bonner mill site near Missoula, and over $350 million in announced data center investment in the Butte area.

**Missoula County** enacted some of the nation's first crypto mining zoning ordinances in 2019, requiring operations to offset 100% of electricity consumption with new renewable energy and restricting mining to industrial zones. The county made these regulations permanent in March 2021. _See_ [GovTech, "Montana Cryptocurrency Zoning Law May Be Country's First" &#x2197;](https://www.govtech.com/policy/montana-cryptocurrency-zoning-law-may-be-countrys-first.html). SB 178's statewide preemption of local government restrictions on mining (2023) created a direct tension with Missoula County's existing ordinance, and the practical interaction between the state preemption and previously enacted local rules remains an area of ongoing legal interpretation.

## Legislative Developments

Montana's crypto legislation spans three legislative sessions:

**66th Legislature (2019):**

* **HB 584** — Utility token exemption. Signed May 8, 2019; sunset September 30, 2023.

**68th Legislature (2023):**

* **SB 178** — Right to mine, digital assets as personal property, anti-discriminatory taxation. Signed May 2, 2023.

**69th Legislature (2025):**

* **SB 265** — Financial Freedom and Innovation Act. Signed May 5, 2025; effective October 1, 2025.
* **SB 330** — [Blockchain and Digital Innovation Task Force &#x2197;](https://doa.mt.gov/BDITF). 19-member body reporting to the Legislature by July 1, 2026. Signed May 5, 2025.
* **SB 426** — UCC modernization for digital assets (Article 12-style provisions for controllable electronic records). Signed April 17, 2025; effective October 1, 2025. _See_ [University of Montana announcement &#x2197;](https://www.umt.edu/news/2025/05/053025lawb.php).
* **HB 424** — Data center property tax reduction (0.9% rate extended through 2037). Signed May 13, 2025.

## Practical Considerations

**Token offerings.** The HB 584 utility token exemption expired September 30, 2023 and is no longer available. Under SB 265 (effective October 2025), issuers of network tokens may apply for certification with the Commissioner of Securities and Insurance for a state securities exemption, subject to a $250 million annual sales cap. Federal securities law remains independently applicable — state certification does not address SEC registration requirements.

**Money transmission.** Montana imposes no state-level money transmitter licensing. Businesses operating from Montana need only federal FinCEN registration and BSA/AML compliance. This is a significant competitive advantage, but practitioners should note that most other states do require licensure, and interstate operations will trigger licensing obligations elsewhere.

**Mining.** SB 178 prohibits discriminatory utility rates and local government zoning restrictions targeting miners. However, the interplay between state preemption and pre-existing local ordinances (such as Missoula County's) warrants site-specific legal analysis. ERCOT-style grid participation programs do not exist in Montana.

**Tax.** Montana has no sales tax and prohibits discriminatory taxation of crypto as a payment method (SB 178). Income tax rates are 4.7-5.9%, with long-term capital gains taxed at reduced rates of 3.0-4.1% plus a 2% capital gains credit. _See_ [Montana Department of Revenue &#x2197;](https://revenue.mt.gov/taxes/montana-tax-tables-and-deductions).
