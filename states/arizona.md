# 2.03 - Arizona

## Overview

Arizona has established itself as one of the most legislatively active states in the nation regarding cryptocurrency and blockchain regulation. Since 2017, Arizona has achieved several national firsts: it was among the earliest states to legally recognize blockchain signatures and smart contracts (HB 2417, 2017), it created the nation's first regulatory sandbox for fintech innovation (HB 2434, 2018), and it became the first state to exempt cryptocurrency airdrops from state income tax (HB 2204, 2022). The state has enacted at least seven crypto-specific laws spanning blockchain recognition, securities, money transmission, mining, tax treatment, consumer protection, and digital asset reserves.

A defining feature of Arizona's crypto policy landscape since 2023 has been the tension between a Republican-controlled legislature that has aggressively pursued pro-crypto legislation and Governor Katie Hobbs (D), who vetoed four major crypto bills in the 2025 session alone while signing more narrowly tailored measures focused on consumer protection and home mining rights. The principal legislative architects have been Senator Wendy Rogers (R-Flagstaff), who has sponsored the most crypto bills of any Arizona legislator, and Representative Jeff Weninger (R-Chandler), who championed the state's blockchain recognition law in 2017 and the unclaimed digital assets reserve in 2025.

## Blockchain and Smart Contract Recognition

Arizona was among the first states to formally recognize blockchain technology through [HB 2417 &#x2197;](https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/53leg/1r/bills/hb2417p.htm), signed by Governor Doug Ducey on April 3, 2017. The law added Article 5 to the Arizona Electronic Transactions Act, codified at [ARS § 44-7061 &#x2197;](https://www.azleg.gov/ars/44/07061.htm), establishing three key legal principles: (1) a signature secured through blockchain technology is deemed an electronic signature; (2) a record or contract secured through blockchain technology is deemed an electronic record; and (3) a smart contract term may not be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability solely because it is a smart contract term. The statute also affirms that a person who uses blockchain technology to secure information retains the same ownership rights as before.

ARS § 44-7061 defines "blockchain technology" as distributed ledger technology that uses a distributed, decentralized, shared, and replicated ledger — which may be public or private, permissioned or permissionless, or driven by tokenized crypto economics or tokenless — where the data is protected with cryptography, is immutable and auditable, and provides an uncensored truth. A "smart contract" is defined as an event-driven program, with state, that runs on such a ledger and that can take custody over and instruct transfer of assets on that ledger. These provisions apply to transactions governed by UCC Articles 2 (Sales), 2A (Leases), and 7 (Documents of Title). The statute has not been amended since enactment and remains in effect as originally written.

## FinTech Regulatory Sandbox

In March 2018, Arizona became the first state in the nation to create a fintech regulatory sandbox when Governor Ducey signed [HB 2434 &#x2197;](https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/53leg/2r/bills/hb2434p.htm). Codified at [ARS §§ 41-5601 through 41-5612 &#x2197;](https://law.justia.com/codes/arizona/title-41/chapter-55/), the program is administered by the Arizona Attorney General's Office and allows approved companies to test innovative financial products or services — including blockchain and cryptocurrency products — for up to 24 months (with a possible 12-month extension) without full state licensure. Participants may serve up to 10,000 Arizona consumers during the testing period.

The [sandbox program &#x2197;](https://www.azag.gov/sandbox) began accepting applications on August 3, 2018, and has admitted several crypto-related participants, including ALTA (digital payment tokens for cash-intensive businesses), Cryptoenter Corp. (blockchain-based bank integration for cryptocurrency exchange, admitted July 2021), and Yield Park, LLC (cash management using digital dollar custodians and DeFi protocols, admitted March 2022). In the 2025 session, [HB 2906 &#x2197;](https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/57leg/1R/summary/S.2906FIN_ASVETOED.DOCX.htm) proposed renaming the program to the "Financial Technology, Digital Assets and Blockchain Sandbox Program" and expanding its scope to include digital assets; Governor Hobbs vetoed the bill, citing concerns from county treasurers about operational, legal, and accounting challenges.

## Securities Regulation and Virtual Coin Offerings

Arizona regulates securities through the [Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) &#x2197;](https://azcc.gov/securities) Securities Division under the Arizona Securities Act, [ARS § 44-1801 et seq. &#x2197;](https://law.justia.com/codes/arizona/title-44/section-44-1801/) The statute defines "security" broadly to include investment contracts, and the ACC applies the federal _Howey_ test to determine whether digital asset offerings constitute securities.

In 2018, Arizona enacted [HB 2601 &#x2197;](https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/53leg/2r/bills/hb2601p.htm) (Chapter 207), which created a specific framework for virtual coin offerings within the state securities laws. The law added definitions for "virtual coin" and "virtual coin offering" to ARS § 44-1801 and established an intrastate exemption under [ARS § 44-1844 &#x2197;](https://www.azleg.gov/ars/44/01844.htm). Importantly, a token that (1) has not been marketed as an investment and (2) grants the purchaser, within 90 days of receipt, the right to use or develop a blockchain platform falls outside the definition of a "virtual coin offering" and may be exempt from securities registration — Arizona's version of a utility token exception. HB 2601 also created a facilitator safe harbor: a person who facilitates the exchange of a virtual coin is not deemed a dealer if they have a reasonable and good faith belief that the coin is not a securities offering.

The ACC has brought multiple enforcement actions against crypto offerings. In 2022, the ACC entered a consent order against [BlockFi Lending &#x2197;](https://azcc.gov/azinvestor/news/2022/06/30/corporation-commission-joins-with-other-state-securities-regulators-and-the-s.e.c.-to-settle-with-a-digital-asset-lending-platform-for-unlawful-securities-sales), imposing a $943,396 penalty for selling unregistered interest-bearing crypto accounts to 9,891 Arizona accounts holding approximately $155.7 million — part of a coordinated SEC and 32-state settlement. In 2023, the ACC issued a temporary cease-and-desist against [GSPartners &#x2197;](https://azcc.gov/securities/news/2023/12/26/investor-alert-commission-cautions-investors-about-an-alleged-ongoing-crypto-scheme) (including Swiss Valorem Bank and GSB Gold Standard), a crypto MLM scheme; Arizona joined a multistate settlement in 2024 providing investor refunds. In 2024, Arizona joined a $1.5 million multistate settlement against [TradeStation Crypto &#x2197;](https://www.azcc.gov/news/2024/04/11/arizona-joins--1.5-million-multistate-securities-settlement-against--crypto-platform--tradestation) for unregistered crypto interest-earning products. In February 2026, the ACC ordered [Boisselle/Wealthwise &#x2197;](https://azcc.gov/securities/news/2026/02/04/arizona-corporation-commission-orders--1-398-900-in-restitution-for-defrauded-crypto-investors) to pay $1,398,900 in restitution and $75,000 in penalties for soliciting 16 clients into NovaTech and HyperFund crypto fraud schemes.

## Money Transmission

Arizona regulates money transmission under [ARS Title 6, Chapter 12 &#x2197;](https://www.azleg.gov/arsDetail/?title=6) (§§ 6-1201 through 6-1241), administered by the [Arizona Department of Insurance and Financial Institutions (DIFI) &#x2197;](https://difi.az.gov/money-transmitters-dfi). In 2022, Governor Ducey signed [SB 1580 &#x2197;](https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/55leg/2R/laws/0236.pdf), making Arizona among the first states to adopt the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) [Model Money Transmission Modernization Act &#x2197;](https://difi.az.gov/announcementnews/arizona-among-first-states-adopt-model-legislation-money-transmission-services) (effective August 28, 2022). The law defines "monetary value" as "a medium of exchange, whether or not redeemable in money," which regulators have interpreted to encompass receiving, custodying, transmitting, or exchanging virtual currencies.

There is no cryptocurrency-specific exemption from money transmitter licensing in Arizona. Entities engaging in virtual currency transmission activities more than ten times per calendar year for compensation must obtain a license from DIFI through the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System ([NMLS &#x2197;](https://difi.az.gov/money-transmitters-nmls)), including surety bond requirements, background checks, and BSA/AML compliance. Major cryptocurrency exchanges including Coinbase, Gemini, and Binance have obtained Arizona money transmitter licenses.

## Cryptocurrency Kiosk Regulation

On May 12, 2025, Governor Hobbs signed [HB 2387 &#x2197;](https://www.azag.gov/press-release/attorney-general-mayes-announces-new-protections-against-bitcoin-atm-scams-going) into law, establishing one of the nation's most comprehensive regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrency kiosks (Bitcoin ATMs). The law took effect September 26, 2025, and added ARS § 6-1236 to Arizona's money transmission statutes. Key provisions include daily transaction limits of $2,000 for new customers and $10,500 for existing customers; mandatory on-screen fraud warnings with customer acknowledgment; physical or digital transaction receipts; blockchain analytics requirements to prevent transfers to wallets associated with fraud; and 24/7 live customer support.

HB 2387 also requires operators to issue full refunds (including fees) to new customers who report fraud within 30 days and provide a law enforcement report. Beginning January 1, 2026, kiosk operators must obtain a license from DIFI. The Arizona Attorney General enforces violations as unfair or deceptive acts under the Arizona Consumer Fraud Act. The legislation responded to FBI data showing a 99% increase in crypto ATM fraud complaints and Arizona-specific losses exceeding [$177 million in cryptocurrency fraud in 2024 &#x2197;](https://www.azag.gov/press-release/attorney-general-kris-mayes-issues-cryptocurrency-atm-scam-alert-launches-new-fraud).

## Tax Treatment

Arizona has taken several steps to address the tax treatment of digital assets. In July 2022, Governor Ducey signed [HB 2204 &#x2197;](https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/55leg/2R/summary/S.2204FIN_ASPASSEDCONFCOMMITTEE.DOCX.htm), making Arizona the first state to provide an individual income tax subtraction for virtual currency and NFTs received through airdrops (effective January 1, 2023). The law also allows deduction of gas fees (blockchain transaction fees). Arizona's flat 2.5% income tax rate and general conformity with the Internal Revenue Code means that cryptocurrency is otherwise treated as property for capital gains purposes, consistent with federal treatment under IRS Notice 2014-21.

In 2024, [SB 1128 &#x2197;](https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/56leg/2r/bills/sb1128p.htm) was signed into law (effective January 1, 2025), authorizing state agencies to enter agreements with cryptocurrency service providers to accept crypto as payment for amounts due to the state, including tax payments through the Arizona Department of Revenue.

Arizona does not currently exempt cryptocurrency from property taxation. However, in the 2026 legislative session, Senator Rogers introduced [SB 1044 &#x2197;](https://legiscan.com/AZ/bill/SB1044/2026) (statutory property tax exemption for virtual currency) and [SCR 1003 &#x2197;](https://legiscan.com/AZ/bill/SCR1003/2026) (a constitutional amendment to exclude virtual currency from property tax definitions). SCR 1003 would require voter ratification at the November 2026 general election — a strategy that would bypass the Governor's veto authority. SB 1044 passed the Senate Finance Committee on a 4-3 vote. Mining operations housed in qualifying data centers may benefit from transaction privilege tax (TPT) exemptions on equipment under [ARS § 41-1519 &#x2197;](https://www.azleg.gov/ars/41/01519.htm).

## Cryptocurrency Mining

Arizona has emerged as a significant hub for cryptocurrency mining, driven by the Greater Phoenix area's extensive data center infrastructure, competitive land costs, and more than 300 sunny days annually that make solar-powered mining operations attractive. Companies including Bitmain (Chandler), BlokForge (Mesa), and Graymatter Industries (Glendale) maintain significant mining-related operations in the state.

On April 18, 2025, Governor Hobbs signed [HB 2342 &#x2197;](https://legiscan.com/AZ/text/HB2342/id/3146516) into law as Chapter 81, protecting the right of individuals to use computational power in their residences. The law defines "computational power" broadly to include blockchain mining, node validation, artificial intelligence workloads, cloud computing, and high-performance scientific research, and prohibits cities, towns, and counties from enacting zoning or other ordinances that would ban or restrict these activities. This effectively preempts local government authority to single out home-based crypto miners. Notably, Governor Hobbs had vetoed the similar [SB 1236 &#x2197;](https://legiscan.com/AZ/bill/SB1236/2023) in 2023, which would have more broadly prevented local taxation of blockchain node operators; the narrower focus of HB 2342 on protecting home users from outright bans — rather than preempting all local taxation authority — appears to have secured the Governor's support.

## Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve

Arizona has been at the forefront of the state-level movement to establish government cryptocurrency reserves, though the path has been shaped by the legislature-governor dynamic. In 2025, the Legislature passed three bills seeking to create state crypto reserves through different mechanisms, and the Governor vetoed all three: [SB 1025 &#x2197;](https://legiscan.com/AZ/bill/SB1025/2025) (the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, which would have allowed up to 10% of state treasury and retirement funds to be invested in Bitcoin — vetoed May 2, 2025), [SB 1373 &#x2197;](https://legiscan.com/AZ/bill/SB1373/2025) (the Digital Assets Strategic Reserve Fund from seized assets and legislative appropriations — vetoed May 12, 2025), and [HB 2324 &#x2197;](https://legiscan.com/AZ/bill/HB2324/2025) (a reserve funded solely through criminal forfeiture proceeds — vetoed July 1, 2025).

However, Governor Hobbs signed [HB 2749 &#x2197;](https://www.azleg.gov/press/house/57leg/1r/250507weningerhb2749.pdf) on May 7, 2025, making Arizona the second state in the nation (after New Hampshire) to establish a form of Bitcoin reserve. HB 2749 takes a narrower approach: it updates Arizona's unclaimed property laws to account for digital assets, which are deemed abandoned after three years, and directs companies to report unclaimed digital property in its native form rather than liquidating to cash. Any staking rewards, airdrops, or interest earned on unclaimed digital assets are deposited into the newly created Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund in their digital form. The State Treasurer administers the fund and may contract with a qualified custodian — defined to include federal or state-chartered banks, trust companies, or special purpose depository institutions — to hold the assets.

## Legislative Developments and 2026 Session

Arizona has considered more than 22 crypto-related bills since 2022, making it one of the most legislatively active states in the country on digital asset policy. In the 2025 session alone, the Legislature sent eight crypto bills to the Governor's desk: four were signed (HB 2342, HB 2387, HB 2749, and SB 1128) and four were vetoed (SB 1025, SB 1373, HB 2324, and [SB 1095 &#x2197;](https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/57leg/1R/summary/S.1095FIN_ASVETOED.DOCX.htm) — which would have excluded a federal CBDC from the definitions of "money" and "legal tender" under Arizona law). Governor Hobbs's pattern suggests support for consumer protection measures and narrowly tailored legislation, but opposition to bills that commit state or retirement funds to direct cryptocurrency investment, broadly preempt local government authority, or address issues the Governor considers hypothetical.

The 2026 session (57th Legislature, 2nd Regular Session) features several significant pending measures. Beyond the property tax package (SB 1044 / SCR 1003), [SB 1045 &#x2197;](https://legiscan.com/AZ/bill/SB1045/2026) would prohibit local governments from taxing or fining blockchain node operators. [HB 2654 &#x2197;](https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/57leg/1r/bills/hb2654h.htm) would establish the Arizona Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Commission, a 14-member advisory body that would appoint an "Arizona Crypto Czar" to coordinate state and federal blockchain initiatives, with a termination date of July 1, 2028.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Practical Considerations**: Arizona's crypto regulatory environment involves multiple agencies. DIFI oversees money transmission licensing; the ACC Securities Division regulates crypto offerings and enforces against unregistered securities and fraud; and the Attorney General's Office administers the regulatory sandbox and enforces consumer protection laws including the crypto kiosk regulations. Arizona does not offer a special purpose depository institution (SPDI) charter for crypto custody (unlike Wyoming) and does not recognize DAOs as legal entities. Practitioners should also note that while the legislature consistently passes ambitious pro-crypto legislation, the Governor's veto practice means that the enacted law may be significantly narrower than what the legislature intended.
