# 2.05 - California

## Overview

California is the largest U.S. market for cryptocurrency by nearly every measure — venture capital deployment, number of crypto businesses, and consumer adoption. The state's regulatory approach has been marked by a decade of legislative false starts followed by a rapid convergence toward comprehensive regulation. Between 2015 and 2020, four separate crypto licensing bills failed in the Legislature. In 2022, Governor Newsom issued Executive Order N-9-22, making California the first state to announce a comprehensive blockchain regulatory framework — and then vetoed the Legislature's first Digital Financial Assets Law as "premature." One year later, he signed a revised version.

The result is the Digital Financial Assets Law (DFAL), codified at [Financial Code Division 1.25 &#x2197;](https://law.justia.com/codes/california/code-fin/division-1-25/), which will require licensing for any person engaging in digital financial asset business activity with California residents effective July 1, 2026. The DFAL is administered by the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI), which has simultaneously conducted one of the most aggressive state-level enforcement campaigns in the country — issuing desist and refrain orders against every major crypto lending platform (BlockFi, Celsius, Voyager, Nexo), bringing the first state enforcement action against Coinbase's staking program, and launching a focused crackdown on cryptocurrency kiosk operators under newly enacted consumer protection rules.

California thus occupies a distinctive position: the world's largest concentration of crypto venture capital and engineering talent, paired with an increasingly comprehensive and enforcement-heavy regulatory regime.

## The Digital Financial Assets Law (DFAL)

### Legislative History

California's path to a comprehensive crypto licensing regime took seven years and multiple failed attempts.

In 2015, Assemblymember Matt Dababneh introduced [AB 1326 &#x2197;](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1326), a BitLicense-style bill that would have prohibited virtual currency business without a license from the Department of Business Oversight. The Electronic Frontier Foundation and 17 organizations opposed the bill, warning it would drive crypto companies out of California as BitLicense had done in New York. AB 1326 passed the Assembly 55-22 but died in the Senate. A successor bill, [AB 1123 &#x2197;](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB1123) (2017), failed after its author resigned from the Legislature. Assembly Majority Leader Ian Calderon introduced [AB 1489 &#x2197;](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB1489) (2019), based on the Uniform Law Commission's model act, which also failed in committee.

On May 4, 2022, Governor Newsom signed [Executive Order N-9-22 &#x2197;](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/5.4.22-Blockchain-EO-N-9-22-signed.pdf), directing state agencies to develop a comprehensive regulatory framework for blockchain technology harmonized with federal rules — making California the first state to issue such an executive order. Four months later, Newsom vetoed [AB 2269 &#x2197;](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB2269), the Legislature's first Digital Financial Assets Law, despite its 71-0 passage in the Assembly. His [veto message &#x2197;](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/AB-2269-VETO.pdf) called it "premature to lock a licensing structure in statute" without considering forthcoming federal actions, and cited the "tens of millions of dollars" required to stand up the new program.

### Enactment: AB 39 and SB 401 (2023)

Assemblymember Timothy Grayson reintroduced an amended version as [AB 39 &#x2197;](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB39), sponsored by the Consumer Federation of California. Governor Newsom signed AB 39 on October 13, 2023, alongside [SB 401 &#x2197;](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB401) (Limón), which addressed cryptocurrency kiosks. Together, these two bills constitute the Digital Financial Assets Law.

### Key Provisions

The DFAL defines "digital financial asset" as a digital representation of value used as a medium of exchange, unit of account, or store of value that is not legal tender. "Digital financial asset business activity" includes exchanging, transferring, or storing digital financial assets, or engaging in digital financial asset administration (issuing a redeemable digital financial asset). _See_ [Cal. Fin. Code § 3102 &#x2197;](https://law.justia.com/codes/california/code-fin/division-1-25/chapter-1/section-3102/).

Effective July 1, 2026, no person may engage in digital financial asset business activity with or on behalf of a California resident unless licensed by the DFPI, holding a pending application, or qualifying for an exemption. Exempt persons include banks, credit unions, trust companies, and entities registered under the Commodity Exchange Act. The Commissioner may also exempt classes of persons or transactions by regulation or order. Penalties for unlicensed activity reach $100,000 per day.

Licensees must maintain a surety bond or trust account in an amount determined by the DFPI based on the applicant's risk profile, capital sufficient to ensure financial integrity of operations ([§ 3207 &#x2197;](https://law.justia.com/codes/california/code-fin/division-1-25/chapter-2/section-3207/)), written policies covering information security, AML compliance, fraud prevention, and risk management, and records for a minimum of five years.

**Stablecoin provisions.** No person may exchange, transfer, or store stablecoins unless the issuer is a licensee, applicant, bank, or trust company, and at all times maintains eligible securities equal to or exceeding the value of outstanding stablecoins. AB 1934 (2024) added a requirement that the Commissioner must approve each stablecoin and that licensees must maintain monthly compliance reports.

**Kiosk regulation (SB 401).** Cryptocurrency ATM operators may not accept or dispense more than $1,000 per customer per day. Operators must provide clear, bilingual disclosures and transaction receipts. These provisions took effect January 1, 2024.

**Conditional licensing.** The DFAL provides a streamlined path for entities that hold a New York BitLicense issued on or before January 1, 2023 — they may operate under a conditional license while their full California application is under review.

### Implementation Timeline

[AB 1934 &#x2197;](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB1934), signed September 29, 2024, extended the DFAL licensing operative date from July 1, 2025 to July 1, 2026, added enhanced record-keeping requirements, and introduced quarterly CPA examinations of reserves. The DFPI issued an [invitation for public comment &#x2197;](https://dfpi.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/337/2023/11/DFAL-Invitation-for-Comments-11-20-2023.pdf) in November 2023, released [draft proposed regulations &#x2197;](https://dfpi.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/PRO-02-23-Draft-Proposed-Rules.pdf) in October 2024, issued a formal Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in April 2025, and published [modified proposed regulations &#x2197;](https://dfpi.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/PRO_02-23_Modified_Text.pdf) in September 2025. Final regulations are expected before the July 1, 2026 operative date.

The September 2025 modified regulations clarified that "monetary value" as defined in the Money Transmission Act does not include a digital financial asset, and that DFAL licensees are not required to obtain a separate money transmission license for crypto-related activities — resolving a significant prior ambiguity.

## Money Transmission

### Money Transmission Act

California's Money Transmission Act (MTA) is codified at [Financial Code Division 1.2 &#x2197;](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=FIN&division=1.2.&chapter=1.). "Money transmission" includes selling or issuing payment instruments or stored value, and receiving money for transmission. [Section 2030 &#x2197;](https://law.justia.com/codes/california/code-fin/division-1-2/chapter-3/section-2030/) prohibits money transmission without a license or exemption.

The MTA does not expressly reference cryptocurrency. In March 2022, the DFPI issued [Opinion Letter OP-8239 &#x2197;](https://dfpi.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/337/2022/03/OP-8239-3-Digital-Currency-Trading-Platform-2-22-22.pdf), concluding that a virtual currency trading platform's closed-loop buy/sell activity did not constitute money transmission — the direct exchange of cryptocurrency between a platform and customer, where the platform does not facilitate third-party transfers, falls outside the MTA's scope. Additional [opinion letters &#x2197;](https://dfpi.ca.gov/rules-enforcement/laws-and-regulations/opinion-letters-by-law-subject/digital-asset-trading-platform-services/) address other digital asset platform configurations.

[AB 1116 &#x2197;](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB1116), signed October 8, 2023 and effective January 1, 2024, modernized the MTA by adopting portions of the CSBS Model Money Transmission Modernization Act, including expanded exemptions, clarified eligible securities for permissible investments, and updated net worth calculations.

### Licensing Requirements

MTA license applications are filed through NMLS. The filing fee is $5,000 (non-refundable). Minimum tangible net worth is $500,000. Surety bonds range from $250,000 (for receiving money for transmission) to $7,000,000, depending on activity type and volume; payment instrument and stored value bonds range from $500,000 to $2,000,000. Background checks and fingerprinting are required for all control persons.

Once the DFAL is fully operative (July 2026), crypto-specific activities will be regulated under the DFAL rather than the MTA, though businesses engaged in traditional money transmission alongside crypto activities may still require both licenses.

## Securities Regulation and Enforcement

### Corporate Securities Law and the Risk Capital Test

California's Corporate Securities Law of 1968 ([Cal. Corp. Code § 25000 et seq. &#x2197;](https://law.justia.com/codes/california/code-civ/)) uses a "qualification" system — the Commissioner must affirmatively approve offerings — rather than the "registration" system used by most states. [Section 25110 &#x2197;](https://law.justia.com/codes/california/code-corp/title-4/division-1/part-2/section-25110/) prohibits offering or selling any security in an issuer transaction unless qualified or exempt.

California applies the "risk capital" test established in _Silver Hills Country Club v. Sobieski_, [55 Cal.2d 811 (1961) &#x2197;](https://law.justia.com/cases/california/supreme-court/2d/55/811.html), which is broader than the federal _Howey_ test. Under _Silver Hills_, a transaction may be a security if it involves: (1) funds raised for a business venture, (2) offered indiscriminately to the public, (3) investors who are substantially powerless to effect success, and (4) investor money that is substantially at risk. Critically, the risk capital test does not require an "expectation of profits" — meaning tokens marketed as "utilities" or "memberships" may still be securities under California law even if they arguably fail _Howey_.

### DFPI Enforcement Actions

The DFPI has been among the most active state securities regulators in pursuing crypto-related enforcement, issuing more than 20 desist and refrain orders and consent orders since 2022. Notable actions include:

* **BlockFi (February 2022):** [Consent order &#x2197;](https://dfpi.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/337/2022/02/Consent-Order-BlockFi-Lending-LLC.pdf) as part of a $50 million multistate settlement over unqualified interest-bearing crypto accounts. BlockFi's California Financing Law license was subsequently revoked in [November 2024 &#x2197;](https://dfpi.ca.gov/press_release/california-dfpi-revokes-crypto-lender-blockfis-finance-lending-license/).
* **Voyager Digital (June 2022):** [Desist and refrain order &#x2197;](https://dfpi.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/337/2022/06/D-R-Voyager-Digital-LLC.pdf) finding interest-earning accounts were unqualified securities. Voyager filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy the following month.
* **Celsius Network (August 2022):** [Desist and refrain order &#x2197;](https://dfpi.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/337/2022/08/D-R-Celsius-Network-Inc.pdf) against the company and CEO Alexander Mashinsky, finding "Earn Rewards" accounts were unqualified securities and alleging antifraud violations.
* **Nexo (January 2023):** $22.5 million [multistate settlement &#x2197;](https://dfpi.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/337/2023/01/Nexo-PR-DFPI-v1.06.pdf) over the Earn Interest Product. In January 2026, the DFPI separately fined Nexo [$500,000 &#x2197;](https://dfpi.ca.gov/press_release/dfpi-fines-crypto-lending-platform-nexo-capital-inc-500000-in-penalties/) for originating 5,456 loans to California residents without a California Financing Law license.
* **Coinbase (June 2023):** [Desist and refrain order &#x2197;](https://dfpi.ca.gov/press_release/dfpi-issues-action-against-coinbase-citing-staking-rewards-program-violates-securities-law/) finding the staking rewards program constituted unqualified securities — affecting 644,470 California residents with combined holdings exceeding $1.28 billion.
* **AI Investment Fraud Sweep (April 2023):** [Five simultaneous orders &#x2197;](https://dfpi.ca.gov/press_release/dfpi-launches-sweep-of-investment-fraud-claiming-ties-to-artificial-intelligence/) against entities including Coinbot, which claimed AI-driven crypto trading with daily profits of 1.5%–6% while operating a Ponzi structure.
* **CryptoFX LLC (June 2023):** [Desist and refrain order &#x2197;](https://dfpi.ca.gov/press_release/dfpi-orders-cryptofx-llc-to-halt-operations-citing-violations-of-california-securities-law/) against an MLM crypto scheme targeting the Latino community through in-person cash investments of $5,000–$20,000.

### DFAL Kiosk Enforcement (2025)

Following enactment of SB 401's kiosk provisions, the DFPI launched a focused enforcement campaign against cryptocurrency ATM operators:

* **Coinme Inc. (June 2025):** [First DFAL enforcement action &#x2197;](https://dfpi.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Consent-Order-Coinme-Inc.pdf) — $300,000 penalty including $51,700 restitution for exceeding the $1,000 daily transaction limit and missing receipt disclosures.
* **LSGT Services / Coinhub (October 2025):** [$675,000 penalty &#x2197;](https://dfpi.ca.gov/press_release/dfpi-cracks-down-on-cash-to-crypto-kiosk-operators/) including $105,000 restitution for fee cap violations, exceeding transaction limits, and inadequate disclosures.
* **HermesBitcoin (September 2025):** [Desist and refrain order &#x2197;](https://dfpi.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/D-R-ANH-Management-LLC-dba-HermesBitcoin.pdf) alleging excessive fees on 2,700+ occasions and missing disclosures on 10,000+ receipts; potential penalties up to $497 million.

## Attorney General Enforcement

Attorney General Rob Bonta has pursued crypto enforcement through the Unfair Competition Law ([Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200 &#x2197;](https://law.justia.com/codes/california/code-bpc/division-7/part-2/chapter-5/article-1/section-17200/)) and the California Commodities Law. In September 2024, the AG's office announced a [$3.9 million settlement &#x2197;](https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-secures-39-million-settlement-cryptocurrency-company) with Robinhood Crypto for Commodities Law violations — finding that Robinhood allowed customers to buy cryptocurrencies without actually delivering the assets and compelled customers to sell back to the platform rather than withdraw.

The DOJ's Cybercrime Section partnered with the DFPI to shut down [42 fraudulent crypto websites in 2024 &#x2197;](https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-protects-californians-shutting-down-42-fake) ($6.5 million in losses, averaging $146,306 per victim) and [26+ additional sites in March 2025 &#x2197;](https://dfpi.ca.gov/press_release/dfpi-strengthens-partnership-with-ca-department-of-justice-to-stop-crypto-scams-and-prevent-consumer-financial-loss/) ($4.6 million in losses), many involving "pig butchering" schemes.

The DFPI's [Crypto Scam Tracker &#x2197;](https://dfpi.ca.gov/consumers/crypto/crypto-scam-tracker/), launched February 2023, received over 2,668 complaints in 2024 alone and now catalogs 303 alerts covering seven scam types — directly feeding the DOJ partnership that has shut down 68+ fraudulent websites.

## Blockchain and Legal Recognition

[AB 2658 &#x2197;](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB2658) (2018) amended California's Civil Code, Government Code, Corporations Code, and Insurance Code to recognize blockchain-secured records as electronic records, blockchain signatures as electronic signatures, and smart contracts as valid contracts under the UETA. The bill also required a blockchain working group to report to the Legislature by July 2020.

In July 2024, the California DMV tokenized 42 million car titles on the Avalanche blockchain — the first project of its kind in the United States. The program enables title transfers in minutes rather than weeks through blockchain-based smart contracts, with a mobile wallet app expected for consumer use.

## Banking and Custody

California does not have a special-purpose crypto bank charter comparable to Wyoming's SPDI. However, Anchorage Digital, founded in San Francisco in 2017, received the first federal OCC national trust bank charter for a crypto company in January 2021, and continues to operate as a federally chartered digital asset bank. Under the DFAL, FDIC-insured banks, credit unions, and California-licensed trust companies are exempt from the licensing requirement.

## Industry Presence

The San Francisco Bay Area remains the dominant U.S. hub for cryptocurrency venture capital and development. Major companies headquartered in the Bay Area include Ripple Labs, Chainlink Labs, Stellar Development Foundation, BitGo (Palo Alto), Compound Labs, Protocol Labs, Brave Software, Lightning Labs, and dYdX. Leading crypto venture capital firms — Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Paradigm, Pantera Capital, and Polychain Capital — are based in the Bay Area, which captured 57% of all U.S. venture funding in 2024.

Two notable departures illustrate the regulatory and tax tensions at play. Kraken, founded in San Francisco, relocated its headquarters to Cheyenne, Wyoming in June 2025, citing the state's "most comprehensive and technically coherent legal framework for digital assets." Coinbase, originally headquartered in San Francisco, went remote-first in 2020 and announced its headquarters move from Delaware to Texas in November 2025. Both companies maintain substantial Bay Area operations and investment teams despite the relocations.

Los Angeles hosts the entertainment-crypto intersection through events like Outer Edge LA (formerly NFT LA) and a growing Web3 gaming sector.

## Practical Considerations

**DFAL licensing.** Businesses exchanging, transferring, or storing digital financial assets for California residents must be licensed under the DFAL by July 1, 2026, have a pending application, or qualify for an exemption. Existing New York BitLicense holders may operate under a conditional license during application review. The DFPI has not yet published final regulations, but entities should begin compliance preparation now. _See_ [DFPI DFAL FAQ &#x2197;](https://dfpi.ca.gov/regulated-industries/digital-financial-assets/digital-financial-assets-law-frequently-asked-questions/).

**Money transmission.** Once the DFAL is fully operative, crypto-specific activities will be regulated under the DFAL rather than the MTA. Businesses engaged in both traditional money transmission and crypto activities may need both licenses. MTA applications go through NMLS with a $5,000 fee and $500,000 minimum tangible net worth.

**Securities enforcement.** The DFPI has demonstrated willingness to pursue desist and refrain orders against both fraudulent operators and major national platforms. California's risk capital test (_Silver Hills_) provides broader theoretical reach than the federal _Howey_ test, meaning that products marketed as "utilities" or "memberships" may still be securities under California law.

**Cryptocurrency kiosks.** Operators must comply with the $1,000 per customer per day transaction limit, bilingual disclosure requirements, and receipt obligations under SB 401. The DFPI's 2025 enforcement campaign — with penalties reaching potential nine figures — signals zero tolerance for noncompliance.

**Tax.** The Franchise Tax Board treats cryptocurrency as property. California has no preferential capital gains rate — all gains are taxed at ordinary income rates up to 13.3%, with no distinction between short-term and long-term holding periods. Residents are taxed on worldwide income.
