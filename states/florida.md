# 2.09 - Florida

## Overview

Florida has emerged as one of the most prominent U.S. states in the cryptocurrency landscape, driven by a combination of political leadership, municipal promotion, industry migration, and an evolving regulatory framework. The state has no individual income tax, making it structurally attractive for crypto investors and businesses, and Miami's branding as the "crypto capital" drew major company relocations and the world's largest Bitcoin conference between 2021 and 2023. At the same time, Florida has experienced some of the most high-profile crypto failures in the country, including the FTX Arena naming rights debacle and the MiamiCoin collapse.

Florida's regulatory approach has been shaped by a landmark criminal case — _State v. Espinoza_, 264 So.3d 1055 (Fla. 3d DCA 2019) — which triggered two rounds of legislative reform and established the contours of the state's current virtual currency framework. The Office of Financial Regulation (OFR) serves as the primary regulator for both money transmission (Chapter 560) and securities (Chapter 517). Governor Ron DeSantis has positioned Florida as a counterweight to federal crypto policy, most notably through first-in-the-nation CBDC prohibition legislation (SB 7054, 2023). The state's legislative trajectory has moved from criminalization (2017) to regulatory clarification (2022) to commercial framework (2025), with ambitious proposals for a strategic Bitcoin reserve and stablecoin pilot pending in the 2026 session.

## Virtual Currency Framework and State v. Espinoza

Florida's virtual currency regulatory framework is rooted in [CS/HB 273 &#x2197;](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2022/273), signed by Governor DeSantis on May 12, 2022 (effective January 1, 2023). The law added a statutory definition of "virtual currency" to [F.S. § 560.103 &#x2197;](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2025/560.103): "a medium of exchange in electronic or digital format that is not currency," excluding gaming tokens and consumer rewards points. Critically, the law narrowed the definition of "money transmitter" to include only an intermediary that has the ability to "unilaterally execute or indefinitely prevent a transaction." This intermediary limitation means that custodial platforms (centralized exchanges, custodial wallets) require licensing, while persons engaged in principal-to-principal, bilateral transactions — such as direct peer-to-peer Bitcoin sales — do not constitute money transmitters.

This framework was the product of the landmark _State v. Espinoza_ litigation. In 2014, Miami Beach police arrested Michell Espinoza, who operated a cash-for-Bitcoin business on LocalBitcoins.com, during an undercover operation. In 2016, Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Teresa Mary Pooler [dismissed all charges &#x2197;](https://law.justia.com/cases/florida/third-district-court-of-appeal/2019/3d16-1860.html), finding that Bitcoin was not "money" under the money transmission statute. On January 30, 2019, the Third District Court of Appeal reversed in [_State v. Espinoza_, 264 So.3d 1055 &#x2197;](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/fl-district-court-of-appeal/1977880.html), holding that Bitcoin qualifies as a "payment instrument" and that the money transmitter definition does not require a third-party intermediary — meaning even bilateral Bitcoin sales could constitute money transmission. The _Espinoza_ reversal directly prompted two legislative responses: [HB 1379 &#x2197;](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2017/01379) (2017), which added virtual currency to the [Florida Money Laundering Act &#x2197;](https://law.justia.com/codes/florida/title-xlvi/chapter-896/section-896-101/) (F.S. § 896.101), and CS/HB 273 (2022), which defined virtual currency and added the intermediary limitation to partially walk back the broadest reading of the appellate decision.

## Money Transmission

Florida regulates money transmission under [Chapter 560 &#x2197;](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2024/Chapter560/All) of the Florida Statutes, administered by the [OFR's Division of Consumer Finance &#x2197;](https://flofr.gov/divisions-offices/division-of-consumer-finance/money-transmitters). Licensing requirements include a minimum net worth of $100,000 (plus $10,000 per additional location, up to $2 million), a surety bond of $50,000 to $2,000,000 (typically 2% of projected yearly transaction volume), FinCEN registration as a money services business, an anti-money laundering program, and criminal background checks through FDLE and the FBI. Florida uses its own OFR licensing portal rather than the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System (NMLS), meaning Florida license numbers are separate from NMLS identifiers. Major cryptocurrency exchanges including Coinbase, Gemini, BitPay, Kraken, Cash App, PayPal, and Binance.US hold Florida money transmitter licenses.

Virtual currency transmitters face an additional requirement under [F.S. § 560.210 &#x2197;](https://law.justia.com/codes/florida/title-xxxiii/chapter-560/part-ii/section-560-210/): they must hold virtual currency of the same type and amount owed or obligated to the recipient during the period of transmission. Detailed recordkeeping requirements under [Rule 69V-560.7031 &#x2197;](https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/florida/Fla-Admin-Code-Ann-R-69V-560-7031) (effective February 16, 2023) require daily records of each virtual currency transmission, including the type of cryptocurrency, method of payment, date of completion, fees charged, and wallet host identities. Criminal penalties for unlicensed money transmission, including virtual currency transmission, are tiered under [F.S. § 560.125 &#x2197;](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2025/560.125): third-degree felony ($300-$20,000), second-degree felony ($20,000-$100,000), and first-degree felony ($100,000 or more, up to 30 years imprisonment).

## Securities Regulation

Florida's [Securities and Investor Protection Act &#x2197;](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2024/Chapter517/All) (Chapter 517) is administered by the OFR's Division of Securities. The statute defines "security" broadly under [F.S. § 517.021 &#x2197;](https://law.justia.com/codes/florida/title-xxxiii/chapter-517/section-517-021/) to include investment contracts, and the OFR applies the federal _Howey_ test to determine whether digital asset offerings constitute securities. ICOs and token offerings where purchasers invest with an expectation of profits from others' efforts are likely securities requiring registration. Florida also offers an intrastate crowdfunding exemption under [F.S. § 517.0611 &#x2197;](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2025/517.0611) (up to $5 million), though the OFR has not confirmed its availability for digital asset offerings.

In November 2023, the OFR issued an [immediate final order against GS Partners &#x2197;](https://flofr.gov/news/details/ofr-issues-immediate-final-order-to-gsb-ltd--d-b-a-gs-partners) for unregistered and fraudulent securities offerings involving crypto investments marketed through a multilevel marketing scheme. The action was coordinated with regulators across multiple U.S. states and Canadian provinces. The OFR has not issued standalone guidance on ICOs or digital asset securities, instead applying existing Chapter 517 provisions on a case-by-case basis.

## Criminal Law and Money Laundering

Florida's Money Laundering Act ([F.S. § 896.101 &#x2197;](https://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0800-0899/0896/Sections/0896.101.html)) was amended by [HB 1379 &#x2197;](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2017/01379) (signed June 23, 2017, effective July 1, 2017) to add "virtual currency" to the definition of "monetary instruments" — a direct legislative response to the _Espinoza_ trial court's finding that Bitcoin was not a monetary instrument. Virtual currency is defined as "a medium of exchange in electronic or digital format that is not a coin or currency." Money laundering penalties involving virtual currency follow the same tiered structure as traditional monetary instruments: third-degree felony (over $300), second-degree felony ($20,000+), and first-degree felony ($100,000+, up to 30 years and fines up to $500,000).

Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody established the [Cyber Fraud Enforcement Unit &#x2197;](https://www.myfloridalegal.com/newsrelease/attorney-general-moody-files-criminal-charges-against-two-men-operating-crypto-money) (CFEU) in early 2023, which has secured approximately $10.6 million in total recoveries through 2024, opened 70 cases, and frozen approximately $8.5 million in illicit cryptocurrency. Notable actions include criminal charges against operators of an [$8 million crypto-to-Colombia laundering scheme &#x2197;](https://www.myfloridalegal.com/newsrelease/attorney-general-moody-files-criminal-charges-against-two-men-operating-crypto-money) (May 2024) and the dismantling of an [Orlando dark web cybercrime ring &#x2197;](https://www.myfloridalegal.com/newsrelease/ag-moodys-statewide-prosecutors-and-fdle-shut-down-complex-cybercrime-scheme-involving) using cryptocurrency for identity theft (July 2023). At the federal level, the Southern District of Florida has been one of the most active jurisdictions for crypto prosecutions, including the [EmpiresX $100 million fraud &#x2197;](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdfl/pr/three-men-charged-100-million-cryptocurrency-fraud) (2022), [Operation TORnado's $34 million dark web forfeiture &#x2197;](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdfl/pr/united-states-secure-forfeiture-millions-cryptocurrency-used-launder-illicit-dark-web), and a [drug cartel cryptocurrency laundering network &#x2197;](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdfl/pr/fifteen-defendants-charged-operation-targeting-conversion-bulk-us-cash-proceeds-drug) involving 15 defendants (November 2024).

## Political Climate and CBDC Legislation

Governor DeSantis signed [SB 7054 &#x2197;](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2023/7054) on May 12, 2023, making Florida among the first states to prohibit central bank digital currencies from the definition of "money" under the state's Uniform Commercial Code. The law amends [F.S. § 671.201 &#x2197;](https://law.justia.com/codes/florida/title-xxxix/chapter-671/section-671-201/) to define CBDC as a digital medium of exchange issued by the Federal Reserve, a federal agency, or a foreign government and made directly available to consumers, and explicitly excludes it from the UCC definition of "money." The legislation passed the House 116-1 and the Senate 34-5 (effective July 1, 2023). At the signing event, DeSantis declared Florida was "saying no to the surveillance state and no to the digital dollar." During his 2024 presidential campaign, DeSantis made crypto policy a central platform element, pledging to "protect Bitcoin," end what he called the federal "war on bitcoin," and send CBDCs "to the trash can."

Florida's Chief Financial Officers have also supported crypto engagement. CFO Jimmy Patronis (2017-2025) noted in October 2024 that Florida held approximately $800 million in crypto-related investments in its broader portfolio and [requested &#x2197;](https://myfloridacfo.com/news/pressreleases/press-release-details/2024/10/29/cfo-jimmy-patronis-to-sba--florida-needs-to-lean-forward-on-cryptocurrency) that the State Board of Administration study the feasibility of allocating retirement system monies to cryptocurrency. His successor, CFO Blaise Ingoglia, [announced &#x2197;](https://myfloridacfo.com/news/pressreleases/press-release-details/2026/01/12/chief-financial-officer-blaise-ingoglia-announces-legislative-priority-to-establish-florida-stablecoin-pilot-program) a Florida Stablecoin Pilot Program as a 2026 legislative priority, backed by HB 1415 and SB 1568, which would authorize the Department of Financial Services to accept eligible payment stablecoins for regulatory fees.

## Miami and the Crypto Capital

Mayor Francis Suarez (2017-2025) became the most prominent municipal crypto advocate in the United States, branding Miami as the future "crypto capital of the world." In November 2021, Suarez began accepting 100% of his salary in Bitcoin (through Strike, a third-party conversion service); by 2025, with Bitcoin exceeding $100,000, he reported being "up about 300%." In August 2021, Miami launched [MiamiCoin &#x2197;](https://www.axios.com/2022/05/20/miamicoin-drop-value-price) through the CityCoins protocol on the Stacks blockchain. The city received a $5.25 million disbursement in February 2022 used for rental assistance, but the token subsequently lost over 95% of its value from its September 2021 peak. By March 2023, OKCoin — the sole exchange listing MiamiCoin — suspended trading, effectively ending the experiment.

Miami hosted the world's largest Bitcoin conferences from 2021 through 2023: Bitcoin 2021 drew 12,000 attendees (where El Salvador announced Bitcoin as legal tender), Bitcoin 2022 attracted 35,000 attendees, and Bitcoin 2023 drew roughly 15,000 during the crypto winter. In the week surrounding Bitcoin 2021, Blockchain.com, BlockTower Capital, eToro, and other firms announced Miami relocations or expansions. However, the conference [departed Miami &#x2197;](https://b.tc/conference/2023/) for Nashville (2024) and Las Vegas (2025). In December 2025, Eileen Higgins was elected mayor — the first woman and first Democrat since 1997 — on a platform focused on affordability and public safety, with no prominent crypto initiatives. Miami's private-sector crypto ecosystem remains active, but the city government has not continued the aggressive promotion that characterized the Suarez era.

## FTX and Its Aftermath

In March 2021, FTX secured a 19-year, $135 million naming rights deal for the Miami-Dade County arena where the NBA's Miami Heat play. The deal, among the most visible corporate sponsorships in crypto, cemented FTX's brand association with Miami. In September 2022, FTX US announced plans to relocate its headquarters from Chicago to Miami's Brickell financial district. Six weeks later, FTX collapsed: after a November 2, 2022 CoinDesk report exposed Alameda Research's dependence on FTX's FTT token, a bank run led to the halt of withdrawals on November 8, and FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on November 11, 2022, with an estimated $8 billion gap in customer funds.

Miami-Dade County moved swiftly to terminate the naming rights agreement, which was approved by the bankruptcy court in January 2023. The arena was renamed [Kaseya Center &#x2197;](https://www.miamidade.gov/district03/Releases/2023-04-03-com-hardemon-rename-arena-to-kaseya-center.asp) in April 2023 under a $117 million, 17-year deal with a Miami-based cybersecurity company. Sam Bankman-Fried was convicted on [all seven counts &#x2197;](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/samuel-bankman-fried-sentenced-25-years-prison) (wire fraud, securities fraud, commodities fraud, money laundering) and sentenced to 25 years on March 28, 2024. FTX-related civil litigation was consolidated in the [Southern District of Florida &#x2197;](https://www.jpml.uscourts.gov/sites/jpml/files/MDL-3076-Transfer_Order-5-23.pdf) (MDL 3076). Remarkably, the FTX bankruptcy estate achieved approximately 119% creditor recovery ($14.7-16.5 billion), with distributions beginning January 3, 2025. Notably, Florida did not enact significant new consumer protection legislation in response to the FTX collapse — a contrast with states like California, which passed its Digital Financial Assets Law in 2023.

## Legislative Developments

Florida's crypto legislative activity has accelerated since 2019. The [Blockchain Task Force &#x2197;](https://www.myfloridacfo.com/docs-sf/cfos-executive-offices-libraries/cos-documents/bctf-final-report.pdf) (SB 1024, 2019) issued recommendations that contributed to subsequent legislation. In 2025, Governor DeSantis signed [SB 1666 &#x2197;](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2025/1666), adopting UCC Article 12 for controllable electronic records (effective July 1, 2025), which provides a commercial law framework for digital asset transfers, secured transactions, and "qualifying purchaser" protections — making Florida one of the largest states to adopt the uniform framework.

Bitcoin reserve proposals have faced repeated difficulty. [HB 487 and SB 550 &#x2197;](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2025/550) (2025) would have authorized the CFO to invest up to 10% of public funds in Bitcoin, but both were withdrawn when the session ended without a floor vote. The concept was revived in 2026 with a narrower approach: [HB 1039 &#x2197;](https://flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2026/1039/ByCategory) and [SB 1038 &#x2197;](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2026/1038) would create a Florida Strategic Cryptocurrency Reserve Fund managed by the CFO, limited to assets with a market capitalization of at least $500 billion sustained over 24 months — effectively restricting eligible assets to Bitcoin. Virtual currency kiosk regulation has failed twice ([SB 662 &#x2197;](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2024/662) in 2024, [HB 319 &#x2197;](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2025/319) in 2025), though a third attempt ([CS/SB 198 &#x2197;](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2026/198), 2026) is advancing with transaction limits and fraud warning requirements. Florida's [FinTech Sandbox &#x2197;](https://flofr.gov/divisions-offices/division-of-consumer-finance/financial-technology-sandbox-innovator) (F.S. § 559.952) has seen limited uptake: nine businesses applied but none completed the process, according to the OFR's 2024 Biennial Report.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Practical Considerations**: The OFR is the primary regulator for both money transmission (Division of Consumer Finance, Chapter 560) and securities (Division of Securities, Chapter 517). Florida's intermediary limitation means that custodial crypto platforms require licensing while peer-to-peer sellers do not — a significant safe harbor. Virtual currency transmitters must hold the same type and amount of crypto owed to recipients, a requirement unique among states. Florida does not offer a special purpose depository institution (SPDI) charter for crypto custody, though state-chartered trust companies may provide digital asset custody if authorized by the OFR. Florida's lack of state income tax provides an inherent advantage for crypto investors, but federal tax obligations still apply. Practitioners should note that while the legislature and governor are generally crypto-friendly, Bitcoin reserve and kiosk regulation proposals have repeatedly stalled, and enforcement through the AG's Cyber Fraud Unit and OFR remains active.
