# 2.32 - New York

## Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

New York operates the most stringent cryptocurrency regulatory regime of any U.S. state. The centerpiece is the **BitLicense** — a comprehensive licensing framework administered by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) under [23 NYCRR Part 200 ↗](https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/new-york/title-23/chapter-I/part-200), effective since August 8, 2015. New York was the first state to promulgate a dedicated regulatory framework for virtual currency businesses, and its approach has defined one pole of the national debate over crypto regulation.

Where Wyoming pursued legal clarity and exemptions to attract crypto businesses (_see_ Section 2.50, Wyoming), New York pursued **consumer protection and oversight** through a licensing regime modeled on traditional financial services regulation. The BitLicense requires any company engaged in virtual currency business activity involving New York or its residents to obtain a license from NYDFS, submit to ongoing examinations, and maintain comprehensive AML, cybersecurity, and consumer protection programs. The alternative pathway — a New York limited purpose trust company charter — carries even more rigorous requirements.

New York's enforcement apparatus is equally distinctive. Two separate state authorities exercise jurisdiction: **NYDFS** enforces the BitLicense regime through consent orders and penalties, while the **New York Attorney General** wields the Martin Act (N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law §§ 352–353), a securities fraud statute that does not require proof of scienter. Together, these authorities have imposed more than **$2.4 billion** in combined penalties and recoveries against crypto entities since 2021.

The regime has generated sustained controversy. Critics point to a "BitLicense exodus" — at least ten crypto companies ceased New York operations when the regulation took effect — and argue that the licensing burden favors incumbents, stifles innovation, and drives business to more permissive jurisdictions. Defenders counter that New York's framework has protected consumers from the worst industry failures and established compliance standards now adopted by federal regulators. Both perspectives have merit, and practitioners must understand the framework regardless of their assessment of its policy wisdom.

As of February 2026, approximately 34 companies hold BitLicenses and roughly eight hold crypto-focused trust company charters. NYDFS continues to issue guidance expanding the practical scope of the regime, most recently updating custodial structures requirements in September 2025.

## The BitLicense Framework (23 NYCRR Part 200) <a href="#bitlicense" id="bitlicense"></a>

### Origin and Enactment <a href="#bitlicense-origin" id="bitlicense-origin"></a>

The BitLicense was architected by **Benjamin M. Lawsky**, New York's first Superintendent of Financial Services. The proposed regulation was published on July 17, 2014, revised after a public comment period on February 25, 2015, adopted in final form on June 24, 2015, and took effect on **August 8, 2015**. Lawsky departed NYDFS shortly before the effective date.

### Covered Activities (§ 200.2) <a href="#covered-activities" id="covered-activities"></a>

[Section 200.2 ↗](https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/new-york/23-NYCRR-200.2) defines five categories of "Virtual Currency Business Activity" that trigger the licensing requirement when conducted involving New York or a New York resident:

1. **Receiving** virtual currency for transmission or **transmitting** virtual currency
2. **Storing, holding, or maintaining custody or control** of virtual currency on behalf of others
3. **Buying and selling** virtual currency as a customer business
4. **Performing exchange services** as a customer business
5. **Controlling, administering, or issuing** a virtual currency

The jurisdictional trigger is broad: any of these activities involving New York _or_ a New York resident requires a license, regardless of where the company is located.

### Exemptions <a href="#exemptions" id="exemptions"></a>

The following do **not** require a BitLicense:

- **Consumers** using virtual currency solely for investment purposes or for purchasing goods and services
- **Merchants** accepting virtual currency as payment for goods or services
- **Mining** virtual currency (the activity itself, not downstream commercial use)
- **Software development and dissemination** (purely technical services)
- **Providing advice** on buying or selling virtual currency (without conducting transactions)
- **Chartered banks and trust companies** — entities holding a New York limited purpose trust company charter may engage in virtual currency activities without a separate BitLicense

### Application Process and Requirements (§ 200.4) <a href="#application-process" id="application-process"></a>

An application for a BitLicense under [§ 200.4 ↗](https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/new-york/23-NYCRR-200.4) must include:

- A **$5,000 non-refundable application fee**
- A detailed **business plan** and organizational chart
- **Audited financial statements** covering prior fiscal years
- A written **anti-money laundering (AML) program**
- A written **cybersecurity program**
- **Consumer protection policies** and complaint resolution procedures
- A **business continuity and disaster recovery plan**
- **Background check information** — including fingerprinting — for all principals, officers, directors, and shareholders holding 10% or more

NYDFS has a statutory 90-day window to grant or deny applications but may extend this period. In practice, processing has historically taken **12–24 months or longer**, with multiple rounds of supplemental questions. Total application costs — including legal fees, compliance infrastructure buildout, and staff time — routinely **exceed $100,000**. _See_ Section 1.21 (FinCEN) for the federal AML/BSA requirements that overlap with the state program.

### Compliance Obligations <a href="#compliance-obligations" id="compliance-obligations"></a>

**Capital requirements** ([§ 200.8 ↗](https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/new-york/23-NYCRR-200.8)). Each licensee must maintain capital in amounts and forms determined by the Superintendent on a case-by-case basis, considering total assets and liabilities, transaction volume, leverage, off-balance-sheet exposure, and overall risk profile. Capital may be held in cash, virtual currency, or high-quality liquid investment-grade assets.

**Custody and consumer protection** ([§ 200.9 ↗](https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/new-york/23-NYCRR-200.9), [§ 200.19 ↗](https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/new-york/23-NYCRR-200.19)). Licensees must maintain a surety bond or trust account for the benefit of customers, hold virtual currency of the same type and amount as owed to customers, and segregate customer assets from proprietary assets. Licensees must also disclose material risks, provide transaction receipts, and maintain a complaint resolution procedure.

**AML/BSA compliance** ([§ 200.15 ↗](https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/new-york/23-NYCRR-200.15)). Each licensee must maintain a comprehensive written AML program including: internal controls, annual independent testing, a designated compliance officer, ongoing personnel training, and board-approved written policy. Licensees must report aggregate virtual currency transactions exceeding $10,000 in one day within 24 hours, file Suspicious Activity Reports, screen customers against the OFAC Specially Designated Nationals list, conduct enhanced due diligence on foreign entities, and verify identity for transactions exceeding $3,000.

**Books and records** ([§ 200.12 ↗](https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/new-york/23-NYCRR-200.12)). All books and records must be maintained in original form or native file format for **at least seven years**, including transaction documentation, general ledger, bank statements, customer communications, board minutes, and compliance records. NYDFS must be granted immediate access upon request.

**Examination and reporting** ([§ 200.13 ↗](https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/new-york/23-NYCRR-200.13), [§ 200.14 ↗](https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/new-york/23-NYCRR-200.14)). NYDFS conducts examinations of BitLicensees at least every two years (though a 2024 Comptroller audit found an average three-year gap in practice). Licensees must submit quarterly and annual financial statements and annual compliance assessments with officer and director certification.

**Material change approval** ([§ 200.10 ↗](https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/new-york/23-NYCRR-200.10)). Licensees must obtain prior written NYDFS approval before introducing any materially new product, service, or activity, or making a material change to an existing one.

### Conditional BitLicense (2020) <a href="#conditional-bitlicense" id="conditional-bitlicense"></a>

On June 24, 2020, under Superintendent Linda Lacewell, NYDFS proposed the [Conditional BitLicense framework ↗](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/industry_guidance/industry_letters/il20200624_req_comments_proposed_framework). This pathway allows startups and growth-stage companies to operate in New York under a conditional license while partnering with an existing BitLicensee or trust charter holder. The conditional license is temporary — firms must eventually apply for a full BitLicense — and is subject to heightened examination. **PayPal** was the first entity approved under this framework in October 2020, operating in partnership with Paxos Trust Company.

### Assessment Regulation (23 NYCRR Part 102, 2023) <a href="#assessment-regulation" id="assessment-regulation"></a>

Adopted [April 19, 2023 ↗](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/reports_and_publications/press_releases/pr202304171), this regulation established a cost-recovery mechanism for NYDFS supervision of virtual currency businesses. Licensed entities are assessed based on two components: a _regulatory component_ (examination costs, split evenly among licensees) and a _supervisory component_ (based on average customer assets under custody and total transaction volume). Five assessments are levied annually — four quarterly plus a final reconciliation.

### Approved Licensees <a href="#approved-licensees" id="approved-licensees"></a>

Approximately **34 companies** have been approved for BitLicenses since the program launched. Major licensees include:

| Company | Date Granted |
|---------|-------------|
| Circle Internet Financial | September 22, 2015 |
| XRP II, LLC (Ripple) | June 13, 2016 |
| Coinbase, Inc. | January 17, 2017 |
| bitFlyer USA | November 28, 2017 |
| Genesis Global Trading | May 17, 2018 |
| Square, Inc. (now Block) | June 18, 2018 |
| BitPay, Inc. | July 16, 2018 |
| Robinhood Crypto | January 24, 2019 |
| Bitstamp USA | April 9, 2019 |
| SoFi Digital Assets | December 3, 2019 |
| PayPal (Conditional) | October 21, 2020 |
| Bakkt Marketplace | ~March 2021 |
| Anchorage Digital NY | ~December 2024 |

**Denials.** NYDFS [denied Bittrex's application ↗](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/reports_and_publications/press_releases/pr1904101) on April 10, 2019, citing inadequate BSA/AML, KYC, and OFAC controls. Bittrex later faced SEC enforcement and filed for bankruptcy.

**Surrenders.** Xapo surrendered its BitLicense in January 2022, ceasing all New York operations. Genesis Global Trading surrendered its license as part of an $8 million NYDFS settlement in January 2024. Tagomi Trading surrendered its license following acquisition by Coinbase.

## Banking and Trust Companies <a href="#trust-companies" id="trust-companies"></a>

New York offers a **limited purpose trust company charter** under the New York Banking Law as an alternative pathway for crypto businesses. This route carries higher capital requirements and more rigorous bank-level examinations, but provides broader operational authority — including fiduciary powers, deposit-taking, and the ability to issue stablecoins under direct NYDFS supervision. Trust charter holders are recognized as **qualified custodians** under various federal regulatory frameworks.

A trust charter holder does **not** need a separate BitLicense.

| Feature | BitLicense | Trust Company Charter |
|---------|------------|----------------------|
| Regulatory basis | 23 NYCRR Part 200 | NY Banking Law |
| Primary activities | Transmission, exchange, custody | Custody, fiduciary, deposits, stablecoin issuance |
| Capital requirements | Case-by-case (Superintendent) | Higher; bank-level standards |
| Institutional services | Limited by license scope | Full fiduciary and custodial powers |
| Stablecoin issuance | With approval | Primary vehicle |
| Qualified custodian | Limited recognition | Broadly recognized (SEC, CFTC) |

**Major trust companies (crypto-focused):**

- **Paxos Trust Company** (chartered May 7, 2015) — first crypto trust charter; issues USDP (Pax Dollar); previously issued BUSD for Binance until ordered to stop (February 2023); subject to $48.5M consent order (August 2025). _See_ Section 1.22 (OCC) for Paxos's additional OCC conditional national trust bank approval (December 2025).
- **Gemini Trust Company** (chartered October 5, 2015) — founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss; issues Gemini Dollar (GUSD); subject to $50M AG settlement (2024).
- **Coinbase Custody Trust Company** (chartered October 23, 2018) — institutional-grade custody services.
- **Fidelity Digital Asset Services** (chartered November 19, 2019) — institutional custody. _See_ Section 1.22 (OCC) for Fidelity's additional OCC conditional approval (December 2025).
- **BitGo New York Trust Company** (chartered March 4, 2021) — institutional custody. _See_ Section 1.22 (OCC) for BitGo's additional OCC conditional approval (December 2025).
- **GMO-Z.com Trust Company** (~2020) — issues stablecoins GYEN (JPY-backed) and ZUSD (USD-backed).

## NYDFS Guidance and Policy <a href="#nydfs-guidance" id="nydfs-guidance"></a>

The text of 23 NYCRR Part 200 has remained substantially unchanged since 2015. The practical evolution of New York's regime has occurred through **NYDFS industry letters and guidance** that have expanded and refined the regulatory framework considerably.

### Greenlist and Coin-Listing Framework <a href="#greenlist" id="greenlist"></a>

The Greenlist is a set of pre-approved coins that NYDFS-regulated entities may list without individual prior approval. As of the [September 2023 update ↗](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/industry_guidance/industry_letters/il20230918_gen_framework_greenlisted_coins), the Greenlist was reduced to eight assets: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Gemini Dollar (GUSD), GMO JPY (GYEN), GMO USD (ZUSD), Pax Gold (PAXG), Pax Dollar (USDP), and PayPal USD (PYUSD). Notably removed were Litecoin, XRP, Dogecoin, and various other altcoins previously listed.

Under the [November 2023 coin-listing guidance ↗](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/industry_guidance/industry_letters/il20231115_listing_virtual_currencies), entities wishing to self-certify additional coins must create a coin-listing policy approved by NYDFS and maintain an approved coin-delisting policy. Greenlisted coins may be listed with advance notice — but no prior approval — provided the entity has an approved delisting policy.

### Stablecoin Oversight <a href="#stablecoin-oversight" id="stablecoin-oversight"></a>

NYDFS became the **first U.S. financial regulator to issue stablecoin standards** with its [June 8, 2022 guidance ↗](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/industry_guidance/industry_letters/il20220608_issuance_stablecoins). Requirements for USD-backed stablecoins issued under NYDFS oversight include:

- **Full backing** by reserve assets at all times
- **Eligible reserves** limited to: U.S. Treasury obligations, government money market funds, FDIC-insured deposits, and reverse repos collateralized by U.S. Treasuries
- **Segregation** of reserves from proprietary assets
- **Monthly attestation** by an independent CPA approved by NYDFS
- **Redemption at par** (1:1 with USD)
- **Prior written NYDFS approval** before issuing any new stablecoin

This guidance predates — and influenced — the federal stablecoin framework under the GENIUS Act (2025). _See_ Section 1.02 (Federal Statutes) for the GENIUS Act's national stablecoin regime.

**Paxos and BUSD.** On February 13, 2023, NYDFS [ordered Paxos to cease minting new BUSD ↗](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/consumers/alerts/Paxos_and_Binance), citing unresolved issues related to Paxos's oversight of its Binance relationship. The SEC separately issued a Wells Notice alleging BUSD was an unregistered security; Paxos "categorically disagreed." At the time of the order, BUSD held approximately $16 billion in reserves. In August 2025, NYDFS and Paxos settled for $48.5 million. _See_ Section 1.10 (SEC).

**PYUSD.** PayPal launched its stablecoin — PayPal USD (PYUSD) — on August 7, 2023, issued by Paxos Trust Company under NYDFS supervision. PYUSD is backed 100% by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term Treasuries, and cash equivalents; redeemable 1:1 for USD; and subject to monthly reserve reports published by Paxos. PYUSD is listed on the NYDFS Greenlist.

### Cybersecurity Regulation (23 NYCRR Part 500) <a href="#cybersecurity" id="cybersecurity"></a>

Originally enacted March 1, 2017, [23 NYCRR Part 500 ↗](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/industry_guidance/cybersecurity) applies to all DFS-regulated financial services companies, including BitLicensees and trust-chartered crypto companies. Significant [November 2023 amendments ↗](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/industry_guidance/cybersecurity) expanded requirements to include mandatory annual CISO reporting to the board, enhanced access controls and password policies, ransomware defense provisions, and expanded risk assessment requirements, with staggered compliance deadlines through November 1, 2025.

### Custodial Structures and Blockchain Analytics <a href="#custodial-guidance" id="custodial-guidance"></a>

NYDFS issued [custodial structures guidance ↗](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/industry_guidance/industry_letters/il20230123_guidance_custodial_structures) in January 2023 — requiring segregation of customer assets and prohibiting use of customer virtual currency to secure credit — and [updated it ↗](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/industry-guidance/industry-letters/il20250930-updated-guidance-custodial-structures) in September 2025 with additional direction on sub-custodians, permissible uses of customer assets, and separate on-chain wallet requirements.

Separately, NYDFS has issued blockchain analytics guidance in [April 2022 ↗](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/industry_guidance/industry_letters/il20220428_guidance_use_blockchain_analytics), February 2023, and September 2025, establishing blockchain analytics tools as a best practice and extending the guidance to New York state banking organizations contemplating virtual currency activities.

## Securities Enforcement: The Martin Act <a href="#martin-act" id="martin-act"></a>

The New York Attorney General wields the [Martin Act ↗](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/GBS/A23-A) (N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law §§ 352–353), one of the most powerful state securities enforcement tools in the country. The Martin Act authorizes the AG to investigate and prosecute fraud in connection with the offer, sale, or purchase of securities and commodities within or from New York. Critically, the Martin Act **does not require proof of scienter** (intent to defraud) — a significantly lower burden than federal securities fraud under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act. _See_ Section 1.10 (SEC) and Section 1.02 (Federal Statutes) for federal securities enforcement, which does require scienter.

### OAG Virtual Markets Integrity Initiative (2018)

In April 2018, the AG's office launched the [Virtual Markets Integrity Initiative ↗](https://virtualmarkets.ag.ny.gov/), sending questionnaires to 13 major crypto trading platforms. The resulting September 2018 report found widespread failures to monitor abusive trading, insufficient controls on automated "bot" trading, and prevalent conflicts of interest. Three platforms — Binance, Gate.io, and Kraken — were referred to NYDFS for potentially operating unlawfully in New York.

### Major AG Enforcement Actions <a href="#ag-enforcement" id="ag-enforcement"></a>

**iFinex/Bitfinex/Tether — $18.5 million** (February 2021). The AG [alleged ↗](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/attorney-general-james-ends-virtual-currency-trading-platform-bitfinexs-illegal) that iFinex and Tether made false statements about Tether's backing and concealed $850 million in commingled losses. Settlement required Tether to cease all trading activity with New Yorkers and provide quarterly transparency reports on reserves for two years.

**Coinseed — $3 million+** (2021). The AG [sued ↗](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/attorney-general-james-sues-shut-down-illegal-cryptocurrency-trading-platform-and) for operating an unregistered commodities broker-dealer, selling unregistered securities, and making false disclosures. A default judgment was entered in September 2021 after defendants failed to respond. A permanent receiver was appointed to wind down operations.

**Gemini/Genesis/DCG — $50 million + $2 billion** (2023–2024). The AG [alleged ↗](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2024/attorney-general-james-secures-settlement-worth-2-billion-crypto-firm-genesis) fraud involving the Gemini Earn program affecting 230,000+ investors, including 29,000 New Yorkers. The AG recovered [$50 million from Gemini ↗](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2024/attorney-general-james-recovers-50-million-crypto-firm-gemini-defrauded) and secured a $2 billion settlement from Genesis in May 2024.

**Celsius/Mashinsky** (2023–2025). The AG [sued ↗](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-sues-former-ceo-celsius-cryptocurrency-platform-defrauding) former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky for defrauding hundreds of thousands of investors. Federal charges were also filed by the SEC, CFTC, and DOJ. Mashinsky pled guilty to two fraud counts in December 2024 and was sentenced to **12 years in prison** in May 2025. _See_ Section 1.10 (SEC) and Section 1.11 (CFTC).

**Galaxy Digital — $200 million** (March 2025). The AG [alleged ↗](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2025/attorney-general-james-secures-200-million-galaxy-digital-promoting-luna) that Galaxy promoted LUNA/TERRA without disclosing its financial interest, having purchased 18.5 million tokens at a 30% discount and selling most while publicly promoting the asset. Galaxy made over $100 million in profits before LUNA's collapse.

**NovaTechFx — $1 billion+ alleged** (June 2024). The AG sued for operating an illegal pyramid scheme defrauding hundreds of thousands of investors, including 11,000+ New Yorkers.

## NYDFS Enforcement Actions <a href="#nydfs-enforcement" id="nydfs-enforcement"></a>

**Robinhood Crypto — $30 million** (August 1, 2022). The [first NYDFS cryptocurrency enforcement action ↗](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2022/08/ea20220801_robinhood.pdf). Consent order cited significant BSA/AML compliance program deficiencies and critical cybersecurity failures under 23 NYCRR Part 500. Robinhood had failed to transition from manual to automated transaction monitoring and failed to disclose investigations by other regulators.

**Coinbase — $100 million** (January 4, 2023). [Consent order ↗](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2023/01/ea20230104_coinbase.pdf) imposed a $50 million penalty plus $50 million in required compliance program investments. Violations included BSA/AML program failures and cybersecurity deficiencies. An independent monitor was appointed.

**Genesis Global Trading — $8 million + license surrender** (January 12, 2024). [Consent order ↗](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/reports_and_publications/press_releases/pr2024011224) cited deficient BSA/AML compliance, transaction monitoring, SAR filings, OFAC screening, and cybersecurity. Genesis also accepted denial of any pending NYDFS applications.

**Paxos Trust Company — $48.5 million** (August 7, 2025). [Consent order ↗](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/reports_and_publications/press_releases/pr20250806) imposed a $26.5 million penalty plus $22 million in mandatory compliance investments. Violations included failure to conduct sufficient due diligence on the Binance partnership, systemic AML compliance failures, and deficient transaction monitoring. A three-year remediation period was imposed.

## Legislative Developments <a href="#legislative-developments" id="legislative-developments"></a>

### Proof-of-Work Mining Moratorium <a href="#mining-moratorium" id="mining-moratorium"></a>

On November 22, 2022, Governor Kathy Hochul signed Assembly Bill A7389-C / Senate Bill S6486-D, imposing a **two-year moratorium** on the issuance of new or renewal permits for electricity-generating facilities reliant on carbon-based fuel that support proof-of-work cryptocurrency mining. The moratorium did not affect facilities using non-carbon energy sources (e.g., hydropower), and existing operations were grandfathered.

The moratorium **expired on November 22, 2024**. Under the statute, the moratorium was to continue until one year after completion of a Generic Environmental Impact Statement (GEIS) by the Department of Environmental Conservation. The DEC released a draft GEIS in May 2025 but had not completed it before the moratorium's expiration. Successor legislation (S.8518) has been introduced to impose an excise tax on energy-intensive proof-of-work mining facilities rather than extending the moratorium.

### Proposed Legislation <a href="#proposed-legislation" id="proposed-legislation"></a>

**CRPTO Act** (May 2023). Attorney General Letitia James proposed the Crypto Regulation, Protection, Transparency, and Oversight Act, which would ban cross-ownership of digital asset issuers, marketplaces, and brokers; prohibit borrowing or lending customer assets; require cybersecurity programs; mandate customer reimbursement for unauthorized transfers; and impose civil penalties up to $10,000 per violation per individual and $100,000 per firm. The CRPTO Act has **not been enacted** as of February 2026.

**Crypto payment acceptance** (2025). Assembly Bill A7788 would authorize New York state agencies to accept cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash) as payment — a notable departure from the state's regulatory posture.

**Federal advocacy** (2025). AG James sent letters to Congressional leaders urging passage of federal cryptocurrency legislation, warning that the absence of strong federal regulations increases risks of fraud and financial instability.

## Industry Impact and Criticism <a href="#industry-impact" id="industry-impact"></a>

### The "BitLicense Exodus" (August 2015) <a href="#bitlicense-exodus" id="bitlicense-exodus"></a>

When the BitLicense took effect on August 8, 2015, at least ten crypto companies immediately ceased New York operations. Companies that departed included **Kraken** (which stated the license "comes at a price that exceeds the market opportunity of servicing New York residents"), **ShapeShift**, **LocalBitcoins**, **BitQuick**, **Paxful**, **Poloniex** (which later returned after Circle's acquisition and BitLicense approval), and several mining services. The industry press dubbed this the "Great Bitcoin Exodus."

### Cost and Burden

The application costs — a $5,000 fee plus an estimated $100,000+ in legal and compliance expenses — and 12–24 month processing timeline place the BitLicense effectively out of reach for early-stage companies. The ongoing compliance burden (quarterly and annual reporting, biennial examinations, annual assessments under Part 102, material change approvals) adds continuing operational cost. As of early 2026, approximately 34 companies hold BitLicenses — a small fraction of the thousands of crypto companies operating globally.

### 2024 Comptroller Audit

A [January 2024 audit ↗](https://www.osc.ny.gov/state-agencies/audits/2024/01/02/virtual-currency-licensing) by State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli (covering July 2018 – July 2023) identified significant execution gaps: incomplete fingerprinting for applicants, unverified tax obligations, risk assessments submitted years before approval, three-year average gaps between examinations (against a two-year standard), and missing compliance assessments and certifications in annual statements. A follow-up audit was published in December 2025.

### Balanced Assessment

The BitLicense regime has undeniably imposed costs on industry participation in New York. It has also provided a regulatory baseline that proved prescient: companies subject to NYDFS oversight generally avoided the custody failures, commingling, and fraud that characterized unregulated platforms like FTX and Celsius. Whether the consumer protection benefits justify the innovation costs remains actively debated. What is clear is that any crypto business seeking to serve New York customers must engage with this framework — avoidance is not a viable strategy for companies with national ambitions.

## Court Decisions <a href="#court-decisions" id="court-decisions"></a>

**Constitutional challenge.** An Article 78 proceeding was filed in October 2015 in the Supreme Court of the State of New York challenging NYDFS's authority to define and regulate virtual currency. The case was heard on October 10, 2017 and **dismissed** on December 27, 2017. No successful constitutional challenge to the BitLicense has been reported as of February 2026.

**Martin Act authority affirmed.** A 2020 court decision upheld the AG's Martin Act authority to investigate virtual currency fraud, confirming that crypto assets fall within the statute's reach.

**Federal cases involving NY-regulated entities.** Several major federal cases involve BitLicensees or trust charter holders, including _SEC v. Coinbase, Inc._ (alleging operation of an unregistered securities exchange; Coinbase defended in part by citing its NYDFS regulation) and criminal proceedings against Alex Mashinsky (Celsius) in the Southern District of New York. _See_ Section 1.10 (SEC) for detailed treatment of _SEC v. Coinbase_.

## Practical Considerations <a href="#practical-considerations" id="practical-considerations"></a>

### Do I Need a BitLicense? <a href="#do-i-need-bitlicense" id="do-i-need-bitlicense"></a>

A BitLicense is required if the business engages in _any_ of the five covered activities (transmission, custody, buying/selling, exchange, issuance) involving New York or a New York resident. Key questions:

1. **Does the business involve New York residents?** If no New York nexus exists, no BitLicense is needed. But "involving" is interpreted broadly — serving NY customers through a website accessible in New York may be sufficient.
2. **Is the activity exempt?** Consumer use, merchant acceptance, mining (only), software development (only), and advisory services (only) are exempt.
3. **Does the entity hold a NY trust charter?** If so, a separate BitLicense is not required for virtual currency activities conducted under the charter.
4. **Should the entity pursue a trust charter instead?** Companies focused on institutional custody, stablecoin issuance, or fiduciary services may benefit from the trust charter pathway despite its higher requirements.

### Application Roadmap

1. **Engage New York regulatory counsel** experienced with NYDFS
2. **Build compliance infrastructure** before applying (AML program, cybersecurity program, consumer protection policies)
3. **Prepare a comprehensive application** addressing all § 200.4 requirements
4. **Budget for $100,000+ in total costs** and 12–24 months of processing time
5. **Respond promptly** to NYDFS supplemental questions (multiple rounds are standard)
6. **Plan for ongoing compliance** costs including assessments under Part 102, biennial examinations, quarterly and annual reporting, and material change approvals

### Trust Charter Alternative

Companies focused on institutional services, custody, or stablecoin issuance should evaluate the trust charter route. The trust charter provides broader operational authority and qualified custodian recognition but requires higher capital and bank-level examination. Several companies (Coinbase, MoonPay, Ripple) hold both a BitLicense and a trust charter for different business lines.
