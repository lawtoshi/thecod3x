# 1.23 - Internal Revenue Service (IRS)

## Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

The Internal Revenue Service was the first major federal agency to issue substantive guidance on the tax treatment of cryptocurrency. In March 2014, the IRS published Notice 2014-21, which classified virtual currency as "property" for federal tax purposes — a foundational determination that subjected all cryptocurrency transactions to the capital gains and losses framework of the Internal Revenue Code. That single classification decision has shaped the entire landscape of digital asset taxation in the United States, requiring taxpayers to track the cost basis and holding period of every unit of cryptocurrency they acquire, use, or dispose of.

For over five years following Notice 2014-21, the IRS issued virtually no additional guidance on digital asset taxation, drawing widespread criticism from taxpayers, practitioners, and members of Congress. The agency broke that silence in 2019 with Revenue Ruling 2019-24 (addressing hard forks and airdrops), the addition of a virtual currency question to Form 1040, and a compliance letter campaign targeting over 10,000 taxpayers suspected of failing to report cryptocurrency transactions. From 2023 forward, the IRS dramatically accelerated its output, issuing revenue rulings on staking rewards, notices on NFT collectibles, and comprehensive broker reporting regulations under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The period from 2023 to 2025 produced more formal IRS digital asset guidance than the preceding nine years combined.

The centerpiece of the IRS's recent digital asset program has been the construction of a third-party information reporting regime through Form 1099-DA. Enacted by Congress in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of November 2021, the broker reporting requirements underwent a multi-year rulemaking process: proposed regulations in August 2023 (REG-122793-19), final regulations in June 2024 (TD 10000), and a controversial extension to decentralized finance in December 2024 (TD 10021). The DeFi broker rule provoked immediate legal challenges and bipartisan congressional opposition, culminating in the first-ever cryptocurrency-specific law enacted in the United States — a Congressional Review Act repeal signed by President Trump on April 10, 2025.

Beyond guidance and reporting infrastructure, the IRS has demonstrated aggressive enforcement capabilities through its Criminal Investigation division (IRS-CI). IRS-CI has been the lead or co-lead agency in some of the largest financial seizures in American history, including the $3.36 billion Silk Road Bitcoin recovery and the $3.6 billion Bitfinex hack seizure. The agency has also wielded John Doe summonses to compel cryptocurrency exchanges — including Coinbase, Kraken, Circle, and SFOX — to disclose customer transaction records, addressing what the IRS has characterized as widespread non-compliance among cryptocurrency holders. In July 2018, the IRS Large Business & International Division designated virtual currency compliance as an official compliance campaign, signaling that systematic audit activity would follow.

The IRS's digital asset program entered a period of uncertainty following the January 2025 departure of Commissioner Daniel Werfel, who had overseen the most productive period of crypto-related rulemaking in the agency's history. The subsequent appointment of Commissioner Billy Long — a former congressman with limited tax experience who departed after approximately two months — and broader questions about the direction of IRS enforcement under the second Trump administration have left the trajectory of digital asset tax policy in flux. The broker reporting framework for centralized intermediaries (TD 10000) remains in effect, with gross proceeds reporting on Form 1099-DA beginning for sales on or after January 1, 2025 and cost basis reporting scheduled for sales on or after January 1, 2026.

The IRS's approach to cryptocurrency taxation is notable for the breadth of tools the agency has deployed. It has used administrative guidance (notices and revenue rulings), the rulemaking process (proposed and final regulations), the Form 1040 itself (the digital asset question), court-authorized information gathering (John Doe summonses), outreach campaigns (compliance letters), and criminal prosecution (IRS-CI). Taken together, these actions constitute the most comprehensive federal regulatory program directed at digital assets, one that intersects with and complements the efforts of [FinCEN](https://www.thecod3x.com/fincen/), the SEC, and the CFTC in their respective domains.

Unlike other federal agencies that have asserted jurisdiction over digital assets — often through enforcement actions rather than prospective guidance — the IRS's involvement flows directly and unambiguously from existing statutory authority. The Internal Revenue Code applies to "all income from whatever source derived" ([26 U.S.C. § 61](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/61)), and the property classification established by Notice 2014-21 fits within well-established tax principles. The question for the IRS has never been whether cryptocurrency transactions are taxable, but rather how to ensure compliance in a rapidly evolving technological environment where traditional information reporting mechanisms are only beginning to take hold.

## Compliance Actions <a href="#compliance-actions" id="compliance-actions"></a>

### LB&I Virtual Currency Compliance Campaign <a href="#lbi-compliance-campaign" id="lbi-compliance-campaign"></a>

In July 2018, the IRS Large Business & International (LB&I) Division designated virtual currency compliance as an official compliance campaign, signaling systematic audit activity directed at cryptocurrency taxpayers. IRS, [_LB&I Compliance Campaigns_](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/large-business-and-international-compliance-campaigns). The designation brought together outreach, education, and examination streams, and represented the IRS's formal institutional commitment to treating digital asset non-compliance as a priority enforcement area rather than a peripheral concern.

### Compliance Letter Campaign (July 2019) <a href="#compliance-letters" id="compliance-letters"></a>

On July 26, 2019, the IRS announced that it had begun sending letters to taxpayers with potentially unreported or misreported virtual currency transactions. IRS, [_IRS Has Begun Sending Letters to Virtual Currency Owners_](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-has-begun-sending-letters-to-virtual-currency-owners-advising-them-to-pay-back-taxes-file-amended-returns-part-of-agencys-larger-efforts) (2019.07.26). Over 10,000 letters were sent through August 2019, drawing on data obtained through the Coinbase John Doe summons and voluntary information reporting by exchanges.

The IRS used four types of communications in the campaign:

* **Letter 6174:** An educational notice advising the taxpayer of potential non-compliance; no response required.
* **Letter 6174-A:** A more pointed notice; no formal response required but compliance strongly encouraged.
* **Letter 6173:** A serious notice requiring the taxpayer to respond with a signed statement under penalty of perjury regarding their virtual currency transactions.
* **Notice CP2000:** A formal underreporter notice indicating a discrepancy between third-party reported information and the taxpayer's return, with a 30-day response deadline.

The campaign was significant as the first large-scale IRS outreach effort directed specifically at cryptocurrency holders. It signaled that the data obtained through John Doe summonses would be used not only for examination purposes but also for broad-based compliance initiatives. The graduated severity of the letters — from purely educational (Letter 6174) to requiring a sworn response (Letter 6173) to asserting a specific underreporter discrepancy (CP2000) — indicated that the IRS was differentiating among taxpayers based on the severity of the suspected non-compliance.

The compliance letter campaign also served a deterrent function beyond its direct recipients. Media coverage of the letters was extensive, and the campaign raised awareness throughout the cryptocurrency community that the IRS was actively monitoring exchange data and identifying non-filers. _See_ IRS, [_IRS Has Begun Sending Letters to Virtual Currency Owners_](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-has-begun-sending-letters-to-virtual-currency-owners-advising-them-to-pay-back-taxes-file-amended-returns-part-of-agencys-larger-efforts) (2019.07.26).

## Foundational Guidance <a href="#foundational-guidance" id="foundational-guidance"></a>

### Notice 2014-21: Virtual Currency as Property <a href="#notice-2014-21" id="notice-2014-21"></a>

On March 25, 2014, the IRS published Notice 2014-21, its first and most consequential guidance on the federal tax treatment of virtual currency. IRS, [_Notice 2014-21_](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf), 2014-16 I.R.B. 938 (2014.03.25). The Notice established that, for federal tax purposes, virtual currency is treated as property, and that general tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency. [_Id._](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf) at Q&A-1. Critically, the IRS held that virtual currency is not treated as currency that could generate foreign currency gain or loss under [26 U.S.C. §§ 985](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/985)--[989](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/989).

The Notice set forth guidance in the form of sixteen FAQs addressing, among other topics:

* Fair market value determination and the treatment of virtual currency paid as wages, which is subject to federal income tax withholding, FICA, and FUTA, and must be reported on Form W-2 (Q&A-2, Q&A-3).
* Payments to independent contractors using virtual currency of $600 or more, which are reportable on Form 1099-MISC (now Form 1099-NEC) (Q&A-4).
* The character of gain or loss, which depends on whether the virtual currency is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer under [26 U.S.C. § 1221](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1221) (Q&A-7).
* Mining income: a taxpayer who "mines" virtual currency realizes gross income upon receipt, and if mining constitutes a trade or business, the net earnings are subject to self-employment tax (Q&A-8, Q&A-9).
* Basis calculation: the basis of virtual currency received as payment for goods or services is the fair market value in U.S. dollars as of the date of receipt (Q&A-6).
* Information reporting and backup withholding obligations (Q&A-15, Q&A-16).

[_Id._](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf) at Q&A-2 through Q&A-16.

The property classification meant that every transaction involving virtual currency — including using cryptocurrency to purchase goods or services — constituted a taxable disposition requiring the taxpayer to calculate gain or loss under [26 U.S.C. § 1001](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1001). This treatment differs significantly from how foreign currencies are treated under the tax code: the IRS's express rejection of currency classification for virtual currency meant that the de minimis exception for personal foreign currency transactions under [26 U.S.C. § 988(e)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/988) — which excludes gains of $200 or less per transaction — does not apply to cryptocurrency transactions. Every disposition, regardless of size, is a taxable event.

Underpayments attributable to virtual currency transactions are subject to penalties under general tax penalty provisions. [_Id._](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf) at Q&A-16.

Notice 2014-21 remained the only significant IRS guidance on cryptocurrency taxation for over five years — a period during which the digital asset market grew from approximately $6 billion in total market capitalization to over $200 billion, thousands of new tokens and protocols were created, decentralized finance emerged as a category, and initial coin offerings raised billions of dollars. The five-year guidance gap drew sustained criticism from practitioners, taxpayers, and congressional oversight bodies, who argued that the sixteen FAQs were inadequate to address the complexity and diversity of digital asset transactions.

_See_ IRS, [_Frequently Asked Questions on Virtual Currency Transactions_](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/frequently-asked-questions-on-virtual-currency-transactions) (updated periodically). The notice was modified in 2023 by Notice 2023-34 (_see_ below) but its core holding — virtual currency as property — remains the foundation of the U.S. digital asset tax regime. The alternative classification — treating cryptocurrency as currency for tax purposes — would have subjected it to the foreign currency gain and loss rules of Subpart J ([26 U.S.C. §§ 985](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/985)--[989](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/989)), a framework that the IRS expressly rejected.

### Revenue Ruling 2019-24: Hard Forks and Airdrops <a href="#revenue-ruling-2019-24" id="revenue-ruling-2019-24"></a>

On October 9, 2019, the IRS published Revenue Ruling 2019-24, its first revenue ruling specifically addressing cryptocurrency transactions — a five-year gap since Notice 2014-21. IRS, [_Rev. Rul. 2019-24_](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rr-19-24.pdf), 2019-44 I.R.B. 1004 (2019.10.09). The ruling addressed two situations involving hard forks, which the IRS defined as protocol changes resulting in a permanent diversion from a legacy distributed ledger that may create a new cryptocurrency on a new ledger. The IRS defined an airdrop as a distribution of units of cryptocurrency to distributed ledger addresses of multiple taxpayers. [_Id._](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rr-19-24.pdf)

In the first situation, where a hard fork occurs but the taxpayer does not receive units of a new cryptocurrency, the IRS held that the taxpayer does not have gross income under [26 U.S.C. § 61](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/61) because there is no accession to wealth. [_Id._](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rr-19-24.pdf)

In the second situation, where a hard fork is followed by an airdrop and the taxpayer does receive units of the new cryptocurrency, the IRS held that the taxpayer has ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the new cryptocurrency at the time it is received — specifically, when the transaction is recorded on the distributed ledger and the taxpayer has dominion and control over the units. [_Id._](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rr-19-24.pdf) The taxpayer's basis in the new cryptocurrency equals its fair market value at the time of receipt.

The ruling was issued simultaneously with substantially expanded FAQs addressing calculation of gain and loss, charitable contributions of virtual currency, specific identification of units sold, cost basis methods (FIFO and specific identification), and fair market value determination. IRS, [_Frequently Asked Questions on Virtual Currency Transactions_](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/frequently-asked-questions-on-virtual-currency-transactions) (2019.10.09).

The practical significance of Rev. Rul. 2019-24 for taxpayers who held cryptocurrency through major hard forks — such as the Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash fork of August 1, 2017 and the Ethereum/Ethereum Classic fork of July 20, 2016 — was substantial. Taxpayers who received airdropped tokens from these events were required to report the fair market value of the new tokens as ordinary income in the year of receipt, even if they took no affirmative action to claim the tokens.

The determination of fair market value at the precise moment of receipt on the distributed ledger created significant compliance challenges, particularly for taxpayers who held cryptocurrency on exchanges that may have credited the new tokens at varying times. For tokens that were airdropped to addresses where the taxpayer had lost access to private keys, the question of whether the taxpayer had "dominion and control" — and therefore a taxable event — remained ambiguous. The ruling's reliance on the "dominion and control" standard, drawn from general income tax principles under [26 U.S.C. § 61](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/61), left open a number of fact-specific questions that subsequent guidance has not fully resolved.

### Revenue Ruling 2023-14: Staking Rewards <a href="#revenue-ruling-2023-14" id="revenue-ruling-2023-14"></a>

On July 31, 2023, the IRS published Revenue Ruling 2023-14, holding that a cash-method taxpayer who receives additional units of cryptocurrency as validation rewards on a proof-of-stake blockchain must include the fair market value of those rewards in gross income in the taxable year in which the taxpayer gains dominion and control. IRS, [_Rev. Rul. 2023-14_](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rr-23-14.pdf), 2023-33 I.R.B. 484 (2023.07.31). The ruling applies to both direct stakers and those staking through centralized exchanges, and the income is characterized as ordinary income rather than capital gain. [_Id._](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rr-23-14.pdf) The taxpayer's basis in the staking rewards equals the amount included in gross income.

The ruling addressed a contested area of tax law. Taxpayer Joshua Jarrett had filed suit in the Middle District of Tennessee arguing that staking rewards should be treated as newly created property — analogous to a baker's bread or an author's manuscript — taxable only upon sale under the realization principle of [26 U.S.C. § 1001](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1001). The IRS issued Rev. Rul. 2023-14 while the Jarrett litigation was pending, formalizing its position that staking rewards are taxable upon receipt regardless of the "newly created property" argument. The IRS mooted the first Jarrett case by issuing a full refund, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed dismissal.

Jarrett filed a second lawsuit on October 10, 2024, regarding the 2020 tax year. _See_ *Jarrett v. United States*, No. 3:24-cv-01453 (M.D. Tenn.). That case remains pending as of February 2026 and, if it reaches a merits determination, could be the first federal court ruling on whether the IRS's approach to staking rewards is consistent with the Internal Revenue Code.

The policy stakes of the Jarrett case are significant. If staking rewards were treated as newly created property taxable only upon sale, the tax consequence for stakers would shift from immediate ordinary income recognition to deferred capital gain — potentially at a lower rate and at a time of the taxpayer's choosing. The IRS's concern is that such treatment would allow stakers to defer income recognition indefinitely, particularly for tokens that are never sold. The Jarrett case is being closely watched by the proof-of-stake ecosystem, which includes Ethereum (following its September 2022 transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake), Cardano, Solana, Polkadot, and numerous other networks.

### Notice 2023-27: NFTs as Collectibles <a href="#notice-2023-27" id="notice-2023-27"></a>

On March 21, 2023, the IRS published Notice 2023-27, announcing its intent to issue guidance on whether certain nonfungible tokens (NFTs) constitute "collectibles" under [26 U.S.C. § 408(m)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/408). IRS, [_Notice 2023-27_](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-23-27.pdf), 2023-17 I.R.B. (2023.03.21). The IRS proposed a "look-through" analysis: the classification of an NFT turns on the nature of the right or asset associated with it. [_Id._](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-23-27.pdf)

If the NFT's associated right or asset is itself a collectible under Section 408(m)(2) — such as a work of art, rug, antique, metal, gem, stamp, coin, alcoholic beverage, or certain other tangible personal property — the NFT is treated as a collectible. If the associated right or asset is not a collectible (for example, a right to use a digital image in a virtual environment, or virtual land), the NFT is not treated as a collectible. [_Id._](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-23-27.pdf)

Collectible classification carries two principal consequences for taxpayers. First, gains from the sale of collectibles held more than one year are taxed at a maximum rate of 28%, rather than the standard 20% maximum long-term capital gains rate applicable to most other capital assets. Second, acquisition of a collectible by an individual retirement account (IRA) is treated as a distribution from the IRA under Section 408(m)(1), potentially triggering income tax and early withdrawal penalties. Written and electronic comments on the notice were due by June 19, 2023. As of February 2026, the IRS has not issued final guidance or regulations following this notice; the look-through framework remains the IRS's stated analytical approach but has not been codified in final form.

### Notice 2023-34: Modification of Notice 2014-21 <a href="#notice-2023-34" id="notice-2023-34"></a>

In April 2023, the IRS issued Notice 2023-34, modifying the Background section of Notice 2014-21 to remove the statement that virtual currency "does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction." IRS, [_Notice 2023-34_](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-23-34.pdf), 2023-19 I.R.B. (2023.04). The modification was necessitated by El Salvador's September 2021 enactment of Bitcoin as legal tender, which rendered the original statement factually inaccurate.

The revised Background section now reads: "In certain contexts, virtual currency may serve one or more of the functions of 'real' currency — i.e., the coin and paper money of the United States or of any other country that is designated as legal tender, circulates, and is customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the country of issuance — but the use of virtual currency to perform 'real' currency functions is limited." [_Id._](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-23-34.pdf)

The sixteen FAQs comprising the operative guidance of Notice 2014-21 remained unchanged. Virtual currency continues to be treated as property — not currency — for U.S. federal tax purposes, regardless of whether a foreign jurisdiction designates it as legal tender. The modification does not alter the IRS position that virtual currency is not foreign currency for purposes of [26 U.S.C. §§ 985](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/985)--[989](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/989), even where a foreign jurisdiction has designated it as legal tender. [_Id._](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-23-34.pdf)

## Tax Treatment of Digital Assets <a href="#tax-treatment" id="tax-treatment"></a>

The IRS's classification of digital assets as property subjects them to a complex web of existing Internal Revenue Code provisions governing property transactions. This section summarizes the principal tax treatment rules that apply to common digital asset transactions, including dispositions, mining and staking, like-kind exchanges, wash sales, charitable contributions, and the reporting forms that taxpayers must use. Practitioners should note that the rapid evolution of the digital asset space — including DeFi, NFTs, wrapped tokens, liquidity pools, and governance tokens — continues to outpace the IRS's guidance, creating areas of significant uncertainty.

### Capital Gains and Losses <a href="#capital-gains-and-losses" id="capital-gains-and-losses"></a>

Under the property framework established by Notice 2014-21, gain or loss from the sale or exchange of a digital asset is computed under [26 U.S.C. § 1001](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1001) as the difference between the amount realized and the taxpayer's adjusted basis. The character of the gain or loss — capital or ordinary — depends on whether the digital asset is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer under [26 U.S.C. § 1221](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1221). For most individual holders, digital assets are capital assets, and gains are subject to the preferential long-term capital gains rates (0%, 15%, or 20%) if held for more than one year, or ordinary income rates if held for one year or less. IRS, [_Notice 2014-21_](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf), Q&A-7 (2014.03.25).

Taxpayers must report each disposition on Form 8949 (Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets), with totals flowing to Schedule D (Form 1040). The use of cryptocurrency to purchase goods or services constitutes a taxable disposition, requiring the taxpayer to calculate and report any gain or loss. This creates a compliance burden unique to digital assets: a taxpayer who uses cryptocurrency to buy a cup of coffee must, in principle, calculate and report the capital gain or loss on the cryptocurrency disposed of in the transaction.

### Charitable Contributions of Digital Assets <a href="#charitable-contributions" id="charitable-contributions"></a>

Charitable contributions of digital assets are governed by the same rules applicable to contributions of other non-cash property, with certain distinctions:

* Digital assets held **more than one year:** The taxpayer is entitled to a deduction equal to the fair market value of the digital asset at the time of donation.
* Digital assets held **one year or less:** The deduction is limited to the lesser of the taxpayer's adjusted basis or the fair market value.
* A **qualified appraisal** is required for deductions exceeding $5,000. Digital assets are not treated as publicly traded securities for purposes of the appraisal threshold, meaning that even large donations of widely traded cryptocurrencies require a qualified appraisal — a distinction that has been criticized as unnecessarily burdensome.
* A **qualified appraisal attached to the return** is required for deductions exceeding $500,000.
* Contributions are reported on **Form 8283** (Noncash Charitable Contributions).

### Reporting Forms <a href="#reporting-forms" id="reporting-forms"></a>

The following forms are relevant to the reporting of digital asset transactions:

| Form | Purpose | Digital Asset Application |
|---|---|---|
| Form 1040 (Digital Asset Question) | Yes/No checkbox on page 1 | All individual filers must answer |
| Form 8949 | Sales and Dispositions of Capital Assets | Report each crypto sale or exchange |
| Schedule D (Form 1040) | Capital Gains and Losses | Aggregated totals from Form 8949 |
| Schedule C (Form 1040) | Profit or Loss from Business | Mining or staking income (trade or business) |
| Schedule SE (Form 1040) | Self-Employment Tax | Self-employment tax on mining/staking income |
| Schedule 1 (Form 1040) | Additional Income | Mining or staking income (hobby), Line 8z |
| Form 1099-DA | Digital Asset Proceeds from Broker Transactions | Issued by brokers beginning 2025 |
| Form 8300 | Report of Cash Payments Over $10,000 | Digital assets excluded pending regulations |
| Form 8283 | Noncash Charitable Contributions | Donated digital assets over $500 |
| Form W-2 | Wage and Tax Statement | Wages paid in digital assets |
| Form 1099-NEC | Nonemployee Compensation | Independent contractor payments in digital assets ($600+) |

The proliferation of reporting forms reflects the breadth of digital asset activity that has tax consequences under the property framework. A single taxpayer who mines cryptocurrency as a business, receives staking rewards, makes charitable donations of cryptocurrency, and sells digital assets on a centralized exchange could be required to complete six or more forms in connection with their digital asset activity alone. The complexity of this reporting burden has fueled demand for specialized cryptocurrency tax software and has been cited by industry participants as a barrier to broader adoption of digital assets for everyday transactions.

### Mining and Staking Income <a href="#mining-and-staking-income" id="mining-and-staking-income"></a>

The IRS treats both mining and staking rewards as gross income upon receipt, valued at fair market value at the time the taxpayer gains dominion and control. IRS, [_Notice 2014-21_](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf), Q&A-8, Q&A-9 (2014.03.25); IRS, [_Rev. Rul. 2023-14_](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rr-23-14.pdf) (2023.07.31).

If the mining or staking activity constitutes a trade or business under [26 U.S.C. § 162](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/162), the income is reported on Schedule C (Form 1040) and is subject to self-employment tax under [26 U.S.C. § 1402](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1402). Ordinary and necessary business expenses — including electricity, hardware, and depreciation of equipment — are deductible against the mining or staking income. Self-employment tax is computed on Schedule SE (Form 1040) at a rate of 15.3% on net earnings up to the Social Security wage base, and 2.9% on net earnings above that threshold.

If the activity constitutes a hobby under [26 U.S.C. § 183](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/183), the income is reportable on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), Line 8z ("Other Income"), but, following the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's suspension of miscellaneous itemized deductions under [26 U.S.C. § 67(g)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/67), no deductions for expenses are permitted. This creates an asymmetric result for hobby miners and stakers: the income is fully taxable, but the associated expenses (electricity, equipment, internet service) generate no offsetting deduction.

The taxpayer's basis in mined or staked cryptocurrency equals the fair market value at the time of receipt — that is, the amount included in gross income. The determination of whether mining or staking constitutes a trade or business versus a hobby depends on the facts and circumstances, evaluated under the factors set forth in [26 C.F.R. § 1.183-2](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-26/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-1/subject-group-ECFRb467872627553f1/section-1.183-2), including the manner in which the activity is carried on, the taxpayer's expertise, the time and effort devoted to the activity, and the taxpayer's history of income or losses with respect to the activity.

### Like-Kind Exchanges (Pre- and Post-TCJA) <a href="#like-kind-exchanges" id="like-kind-exchanges"></a>

Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (P.L. 115-97), enacted December 22, 2017, [26 U.S.C. § 1031](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1031) permitted tax-deferred like-kind exchanges of both real and personal property. This gave rise to a theoretical argument that one cryptocurrency could be exchanged for another on a tax-deferred basis, provided the two assets were of "like kind." The TCJA amended Section 1031 to limit like-kind exchange treatment to real property only, effective for exchanges completed after December 31, 2017. Cryptocurrency, as personal property, is categorically excluded from Section 1031 treatment for all post-2017 exchanges.

As to pre-2018 exchanges, the IRS addressed the question in Chief Counsel Memorandum 202124008, released June 18, 2021. IRS, [_CCA 202124008_](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-wd/202124008.pdf) (2021.06.18). The memorandum analyzed exchanges of Bitcoin for Ether, Bitcoin for Litecoin, and Ether for Litecoin completed before January 1, 2018 and concluded that none qualified as like-kind exchanges. [_Id._](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-wd/202124008.pdf) The IRS reasoned that the cryptocurrencies were not of "like kind" because they have fundamentally different designs, intended uses, and actual uses: Bitcoin's network is designed primarily as a payment network, while Ethereum's blockchain serves as both a payment network and a platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications. Bitcoin and Ether functioned as "on-ramps and off-ramps" for other cryptocurrencies, unlike typical exchangeable property. [_Id._](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-wd/202124008.pdf)

While the memorandum is limited to the specific pairs discussed and may not be cited as precedent, it signals the IRS's skeptical posture toward any pre-2018 crypto-to-crypto like-kind exchange claim. Practitioners should note that taxpayers who claimed Section 1031 treatment on pre-2018 crypto-to-crypto exchanges may face examination risk in light of this memorandum.

An argument could be made that exchanges between units of the same cryptocurrency — for example, Bitcoin held on one exchange for Bitcoin held on another — could have qualified as like-kind exchanges pre-TCJA because the exchanged assets are identical in nature and character. However, such exchanges rarely occur in practice, and the IRS has not addressed this scenario specifically. The academic debate is now largely moot given the TCJA's restriction of Section 1031 to real property for all exchanges after December 31, 2017.

### Wash Sale Rules <a href="#wash-sale-rules" id="wash-sale-rules"></a>

The wash sale rule under [26 U.S.C. § 1091](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1091) does not, as of February 2026, apply to cryptocurrency. Section 1091 applies only to "stock or securities," and the IRS treats cryptocurrency as property rather than as a stock or security. This permits taxpayers to sell cryptocurrency at a loss and immediately repurchase the same asset, harvesting the tax loss without triggering wash sale disallowance — a strategy commonly described as the "crypto wash sale loophole."

Multiple legislative proposals have sought to close this gap. The Build Back Better Act (H.R. 5376, Section 138152) passed the House in 2021 but failed in the Senate; the provision would have amended Section 1091 to apply to digital assets, foreign currencies, and commodities. The Biden administration's FY 2024 and FY 2025 budgets each proposed extending wash sale rules to digital assets, with Treasury estimating $42 billion in revenue over ten years for the FY 2025 proposal. The PARITY Act, introduced by Representatives Miller and Horsford in December 2025, would apply wash sale rules to crypto; it remains in committee as of February 2026.

Even absent formal wash sale rules, the IRS may challenge purely circular cryptocurrency transactions under the economic substance doctrine and business purpose test, as codified in [26 U.S.C. § 7701(o)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7701). A transaction with no economic substance beyond generating a tax loss may be disallowed as a sham transaction, and the taxpayer may be subject to a strict liability penalty of 20% (or 40% if the relevant facts are not adequately disclosed). Practitioners should also note that the final broker reporting regulations (TD 10000) may make crypto wash sales more visible to the IRS, even without a formal statutory prohibition, by creating a paper trail of rapid sell-and-repurchase activity.

The absence of wash sale rules for cryptocurrency remains one of the most significant tax planning opportunities — and one of the most frequently criticized features — of the current digital asset tax regime. Whether Congress will act to close this gap during the current legislative session remains uncertain, though the legislative history suggests sustained interest in extending wash sale treatment to digital assets.

## The Digital Asset Question (Form 1040) <a href="#digital-asset-question" id="digital-asset-question"></a>

Beginning with tax year 2019, the IRS introduced a yes-or-no question on federal income tax returns asking taxpayers about virtual currency transactions. IRS, [_Determine How To Answer the Digital Asset Question_](https://www.irs.gov/filing/determine-how-to-answer-the-digital-asset-question). The question has evolved significantly over six tax years in both its placement, wording, and scope:

* **Tax year 2019:** The question first appeared on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), asking: "At any time during 2019, did you receive, sell, send, exchange, or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?" Because it was on Schedule 1, only taxpayers who otherwise needed to file that schedule were required to answer.

* **Tax year 2020:** The IRS moved the question to page one of Form 1040 and Form 1040-SR, ensuring that all individual filers would encounter it. The wording remained substantially the same. The move to page one was a significant strategic decision: it ensured that the approximately 150 million individual income tax returns filed annually would each contain an affirmative representation about the filer's digital asset activity.

* **Tax year 2021:** The question continued on page one with substantially similar wording.

* **Tax year 2022:** The IRS changed the terminology from "virtual currency" to "digital asset" — expanding the scope to encompass NFTs and stablecoins — and adopted a two-part structure distinguishing between: (a) receipt as a reward, award, or compensation; and (b) sale, exchange, gift, or other disposal of a digital asset.

* **Tax year 2023:** The IRS removed "gift" from the disposition prong and extended the question to Forms 1065 (partnerships), 1120 (corporations), and 1120-S (S corporations), requiring business entities to answer as well.

* **Tax years 2024 and 2025:** Part (a) was refined to replace "compensation" with "payment for property or services."

The question now appears on Forms 1040, 1040-SR, 1040-NR, 1041, 1065, 1120, and 1120-S. False answers are subject to the penalties of perjury. The placement of the question on page one of the primary individual income tax return — a position of maximum visibility — reflects the IRS's view that digital asset non-compliance is a systemic problem warranting heightened taxpayer awareness.

The expansion of the question to business entity returns (Forms 1065, 1120, and 1120-S) beginning in tax year 2023 is particularly significant for investment partnerships, venture capital funds, and corporate treasuries that hold digital assets. These entities must now affirmatively disclose their digital asset activity regardless of whether the activity results in a currently reportable taxable event.

The IRS has published guidance to assist taxpayers in answering the question, clarifying that a taxpayer who merely held digital assets during the year and did not engage in any transactions may answer "No." IRS, [_Determine How To Answer the Digital Asset Question_](https://www.irs.gov/filing/determine-how-to-answer-the-digital-asset-question). However, taxpayers who received digital assets as payment for goods or services, as a reward or award, through mining or staking, through an airdrop or hard fork, or through any other means must answer "Yes," even if they did not sell or otherwise dispose of the digital assets during the year.

The enforcement implications of the digital asset question are substantial. A taxpayer who answers "No" despite having engaged in reportable digital asset transactions during the year has made a false statement under penalty of perjury. This creates an independent basis for penalties and potentially for criminal prosecution, separate from any liability arising from the underlying failure to report income. The question thus serves a dual function: it promotes voluntary compliance by requiring affirmative disclosure, and it creates additional legal exposure for taxpayers who fail to comply.

## Broker Reporting Requirements <a href="#broker-reporting" id="broker-reporting"></a>

### Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (November 2021) <a href="#iija" id="iija"></a>

On November 15, 2021, President Biden signed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (P.L. 117-58). Section 80603 of the Act amended [26 U.S.C. § 6045](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6045) to expand the definition of "broker" to include "any person who (for consideration) is responsible for regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf of another person." The Act also created a statutory definition of "digital asset" as "any digital representation of value which is recorded on a cryptographically secured distributed ledger or any similar technology as specified by the Secretary." [26 U.S.C. § 6045(g)(3)(D)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6045).

The broad broker definition generated immediate controversy during the legislative process. Critics — including Senators Wyden, Toomey, and Lummis, who introduced a failed narrowing amendment — argued that the definition could encompass miners, validators, software developers, and node operators, none of whom have customer relationships or access to the information necessary for tax reporting. The Biden administration's Treasury Department stated publicly that it did not intend for the definition to capture non-custodial participants, but this assurance was not codified in the statutory text and thus did not bind future administrations.

The Act required brokers to file information returns (ultimately designated Form 1099-DA, "Digital Asset Proceeds from Broker Transactions") reporting gross proceeds, cost basis (for covered securities), transaction dates, and customer identifying information. _See_ IRS, [_Instructions for Form 1099-DA_](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1099da). The Form 1099-DA reporting requirement is modeled on the existing Form 1099-B framework for securities transactions, adapted to accommodate the unique characteristics of digital asset transactions, including the potential for transfers between wallets, cross-chain transactions, and the use of decentralized protocols.

The implementation timeline as enacted (and later modified by regulations) provides for gross proceeds reporting (Form 1099-DA) for sales on or after January 1, 2025, and cost basis reporting for covered securities for sales on or after January 1, 2026. The phased implementation reflects the complexity of building digital asset reporting infrastructure and the need for exchanges to develop systems capable of tracking cost basis across what may be millions of customer accounts with complex transaction histories.

### $10,000 Cash Reporting (Section 6050I) <a href="#section-6050i" id="section-6050i"></a>

Section 80603 also amended [26 U.S.C. § 6050I(d)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6050I) to include digital assets within the definition of "cash" for purposes of the $10,000 cash transaction reporting requirement (Form 8300), originally effective January 1, 2024. The provision would require any person engaged in a trade or business who receives more than $10,000 in digital assets in a single transaction (or in two or more related transactions) to file a Form 8300 with the IRS within 15 days and to provide a written statement to the payor.

However, in January 2024, the IRS issued Announcement 2024-4, stating that digital assets are not required to be included in the $10,000 threshold determination until implementing regulations and updated forms are published. IRS, [_Announcement 2024-4_](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/a-24-04.pdf) (2024.01). As of February 2026, no such regulations have been published. The delayed implementation is significant because Section 6050I violations carry potential felony criminal penalties under [26 U.S.C. § 7203](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7203), including up to five years' imprisonment, and the absence of implementing regulations and clear compliance instructions raises due process concerns. The application of criminal penalties to a reporting obligation that lacks implementing guidance was a particular source of concern for the digital asset industry and for constitutional scholars who questioned whether the existing statutory framework provided adequate notice of the conduct required.

### Proposed Regulations (REG-122793-19, August 2023) <a href="#proposed-regulations" id="proposed-regulations"></a>

On August 29, 2023, Treasury and the IRS published proposed regulations implementing the broker reporting provisions of the Infrastructure Act. Gross Proceeds and Basis Reporting by Brokers and Determination of Amount Realized and Basis for Digital Asset Transactions, 88 Fed. Reg. 59576 (proposed 2023.08.29). The proposed regulations defined which entities qualify as brokers under amended Section 6045, proposed Form 1099-DA as the reporting vehicle, and required reporting of gross proceeds and, for covered securities, adjusted basis. The proposals addressed amount realized under [26 U.S.C. § 1001](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1001), basis determination under [26 U.S.C. § 1012](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1012), and backup withholding requirements.

Most controversially, the proposed regulations introduced the concept of a "digital asset middleman" — a category that would have captured certain DeFi participants as brokers subject to information reporting requirements. Under the proposed definition, a digital asset middleman was any person who provides services effectuating sales of digital assets for customers, regardless of whether the person has a traditional broker-customer relationship or custodies customer assets. The proposed definition extended well beyond traditional custodial intermediaries and, in the view of many commentators, would have imposed reporting obligations on entities that lack the ability to collect the taxpayer information necessary for compliance.

The crypto industry characterized the "digital asset middleman" concept as fundamentally incompatible with the architecture of decentralized protocols, where transactions are executed by autonomous smart contracts rather than by human intermediaries. Tax practitioners raised concerns about the administrability of the proposed rules and the potential for over-inclusion.

The public response was extraordinary. The comment deadline was extended from October 30 to November 13, 2023, and a public hearing was held on November 7, 2023. Treasury and the IRS received over 44,000 written comments — a volume reflecting the significant opposition from the DeFi community, industry trade groups, and tax practitioners to the breadth of the proposed "digital asset middleman" definition. _See_ Gross Proceeds and Basis Reporting by Brokers and Determination of Amount Realized and Basis for Digital Asset Transactions, [88 Fed. Reg. 59576](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/08/29/2023-17565/gross-proceeds-and-basis-reporting-by-brokers-and-determination-of-amount-realized-and-basis-for) (2023.08.29).

The volume of public comments was among the highest for any Treasury rulemaking in recent years and demonstrated the intensity of stakeholder engagement on digital asset tax policy. Commentators raised concerns about privacy, the constitutional limits of third-party reporting obligations, the technological feasibility of requiring non-custodial participants to collect customer information, and the potential for the rules to drive DeFi activity offshore.

### Final Regulations (TD 10000, June 2024) <a href="#td-10000" id="td-10000"></a>

On June 28, 2024, Treasury and the IRS announced final broker reporting regulations, published in the Federal Register on July 9, 2024 as TD 10000. Gross Proceeds and Basis Reporting by Brokers and Determination of Amount Realized and Basis for Digital Asset Transactions, 89 Fed. Reg. 56480 (2024.07.09); U.S. Dep't of Treasury, [_Press Release jy2438_](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2438) (2024.06.28).

The final regulations define the following categories of entities as brokers subject to reporting on Form 1099-DA:

* Operators of custodial digital asset trading platforms
* Certain hosted wallet providers
* Digital asset kiosks
* Certain processors of digital asset payments (PDAPs)
* Dealers in digital assets
* Certain issuers of redeemable digital assets

Gross proceeds reporting is required for sales on or after January 1, 2025, and basis reporting for covered securities is required for sales on or after January 1, 2026. The one-year gap between the onset of gross proceeds reporting and basis reporting was designed to allow brokers time to build the systems necessary for tracking and reporting cost basis, which is significantly more complex than reporting gross proceeds alone — it requires tracking the acquisition date, acquisition cost, and holding period of each unit of cryptocurrency, potentially across multiple accounts and years of transaction history.

TD 10000 reserved on the proposed "digital asset middleman" definition as applied to non-custodial and DeFi participants, stating that the issue required additional consideration. The decision to reserve on DeFi was responsive to the extensive public comment opposing the proposed "digital asset middleman" definition. The DeFi question was addressed separately in TD 10021 (_see_ below).

The final regulations require taxpayers to identify specific units of digital assets being sold using the specific identification method; in the absence of an identification, the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method applies by default. Brokers must track basis at the wallet or account level. The FIFO default is significant because it may result in higher taxable gains for taxpayers who acquired digital assets at lower prices in earlier years and did not affirmatively elect specific identification — potentially penalizing taxpayers who were unaware of the election or who used exchanges that did not support specific identification at the account level.

The wallet-level tracking requirement means that a taxpayer who holds the same digital asset across multiple wallets or accounts cannot aggregate basis across those wallets. Each wallet is treated as a separate pool for basis determination purposes, a rule that was designed to facilitate broker reporting but that may complicate tax planning for taxpayers with digital assets spread across multiple platforms.

The IRS simultaneously issued three pieces of accompanying guidance on June 28, 2024:

* **Notice 2024-56** provided transition relief from penalties for failures to report on Form 1099-DA for calendar year 2025 transactions, conditioned on a good-faith compliance effort, and provided transition relief from backup withholding liabilities for 2025.

* **Notice 2024-57** identified specific transaction types exempted from reporting until further guidance is issued, including: wrapping and unwrapping transactions; liquidity provider transactions; staking transactions; lending transactions; short sales; and notional principal contracts. IRS, [_Notice 2024-57_](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-24-57.pdf) (2024.06.28).

* **Revenue Procedure 2024-28** provided transitional guidance for allocating unused basis of digital assets held in wallets or accounts as of January 1, 2025, permitting taxpayers to use any reasonable allocation method. IRS, [_Rev. Proc. 2024-28_](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rp-24-28.pdf) (2024.06.28).

### DeFi Broker Rule (TD 10021, December 2024) <a href="#defi-broker-rule" id="defi-broker-rule"></a>

On December 30, 2024, Treasury and the IRS published final regulations in TD 10021, extending broker reporting obligations to decentralized finance. Gross Proceeds Reporting by Brokers That Regularly Provide Services Effectuating Digital Asset Sales, 90 Fed. Reg. 3030 (2024.12.30); U.S. Dep't of Treasury, [_Press Release jy2762_](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2762) (2024.12.27). The rule defined "trading front-end service providers" — entities providing graphical user interfaces (GUIs) or similar software allowing users to interact with DeFi trading protocols — as "brokers" required to report on Form 1099-DA. The rationale was that front-end providers are "in a position to know" customer transaction details because they provide the interface through which users initiate transactions. Reporting would have been required for sales on or after January 1, 2027.

The DeFi broker rule provoked an immediate and forceful response from the digital asset industry. The DeFi Education Fund, the Blockchain Association, and the Texas Blockchain Council filed lawsuits challenging the rule on both statutory and constitutional grounds. The legal challenges raised several arguments:

* **Statutory authority:** The plaintiffs argued that the Infrastructure Act's broker definition was not intended to encompass software providers that merely offer a user interface for interacting with autonomous smart contracts. The front-end providers do not custody assets, execute trades, or have a traditional broker-customer relationship.
* **Technological infeasibility:** Many DeFi front-ends are open-source software deployed on decentralized infrastructure. Requiring these interfaces to collect, verify, and report customer identifying information is, in the view of the challengers, incompatible with the architecture of decentralized protocols.
* **First Amendment concerns:** Some challengers argued that requiring front-end providers to collect and report user data implicates the First Amendment right to anonymous speech and the right to transact without government surveillance.
* **Privacy and Fourth Amendment:** The rule's requirement that DeFi interfaces collect customer information was characterized as an unconstitutional warrantless search.

Bipartisan congressional opposition emerged rapidly, with members from both parties characterizing the rule as an overreach. _See_ [Treasury](https://www.thecod3x.com/treasury/) section for additional context on the rulemaking process.

### Congressional Review Act Repeal (April 2025) <a href="#cra-repeal" id="cra-repeal"></a>

Congress moved swiftly to invoke the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to nullify TD 10021. On March 4, 2025, the Senate passed S.J. Res. 3, introduced by Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), by a vote of 70-27 — a notably bipartisan margin reflecting opposition to the rule from both parties. On March 11, 2025, the House passed H.J. Res. 25, introduced by Representative Mike Carey (R-OH), by a vote of 292-132. Rep. Mike Carey, [_Carey Bill to Eliminate Burdensome IRS DeFi Crypto Broker Rule Signed into Law by President Trump_](https://carey.house.gov/2025/04/10/carey-bill-to-eliminate-burdensome-irs-defi-crypto-broker-rule-signed-into-law-by-president-trump/) (2025.04.10).

President Trump signed the CRA resolution into law on April 10, 2025 (P.L. 119-7). This was the first cryptocurrency-specific legislation signed into law in the United States — a milestone whose significance extends beyond the immediate invalidation of the DeFi broker rule. The bipartisan margins in both chambers — 70-27 in the Senate and 292-132 in the House — reflected a rare convergence of political interests: Republican skepticism of IRS overreach aligned with Democratic concerns about the technological feasibility of the rule and its potential to push DeFi activity offshore.

The CRA repeal carries two important consequences. First, under the CRA's procedural constraints ([5 U.S.C. § 801(b)(2)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/801)), the IRS is prohibited from issuing any new rule that is "substantially the same" as TD 10021 unless specifically authorized by a subsequent law enacted by Congress. This prohibition effectively forecloses administrative rulemaking on DeFi broker reporting absent new legislation — a significant constraint on future IRS action regardless of which administration is in power. The scope of the "substantially the same" prohibition is not precisely defined and will be the subject of interpretive questions if Treasury attempts to address DeFi reporting through alternative regulatory frameworks.

Second, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the repeal would increase the federal deficit by $3.9 billion over ten years — a figure reflecting Treasury's projection of the tax revenue that DeFi broker reporting would have generated. The revenue estimate underscores the magnitude of digital asset transactions occurring through decentralized protocols beyond the reach of current information reporting infrastructure. It also highlights the fundamental policy tension at the heart of the DeFi reporting debate: the same architectural features that make decentralized protocols resistant to information reporting requirements also create opportunities for tax non-compliance.

On July 11, 2025, Treasury and the IRS formally removed TD 10021 from the Code of Federal Regulations. 90 Fed. Reg. 30825-30826 (2025.07.11). The removal completed the regulatory cycle: from proposed rule to final rule to CRA disapproval to formal excision from the CFR, all within a span of approximately two years. The DeFi broker rule episode stands as a cautionary example of the limits of administrative rulemaking in the digital asset space, particularly when the underlying technology is resistant to the assumptions embedded in traditional regulatory frameworks.

The CRA repeal also has implications for future legislative efforts. Any comprehensive digital asset tax legislation considered by Congress will need to address the question of how — and whether — to extend information reporting obligations to decentralized protocols, either by granting Treasury new statutory authority or by establishing an alternative compliance framework that is compatible with the architecture of DeFi.

### Transition Relief and Implementation <a href="#transition-relief" id="transition-relief"></a>

The IRS has provided extended transition relief for the implementation of broker reporting under TD 10000, recognizing the operational complexity of building compliance infrastructure for digital asset reporting. Notice 2025-33, issued in June 2025, provided the following relief:

* Extended backup withholding relief through calendar year 2026, with backup withholding required beginning in 2027 only if TIN matching fails.
* Extended relief for uncertified TINs of preexisting customers through the end of 2027.
* Extended foreign customer relief for accounts opened before January 1, 2026.

IRS, [_Notice 2025-33_](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-25-33.pdf) (2025.06).

The phased approach reflects the practical challenges that centralized exchanges and other brokers face in obtaining and verifying customer tax identification numbers, particularly for accounts opened before the reporting requirements were finalized. The IRS's willingness to extend transition relief multiple times suggests an awareness that the digital asset reporting infrastructure is being built in real time, and that premature enforcement of reporting penalties could undermine voluntary compliance.

The contrast between the ambitious scope of the broker reporting requirements and the extended transition relief periods highlights a fundamental challenge of digital asset tax administration: the gap between the statutory mandate (all digital asset transactions are taxable events) and the operational reality (the infrastructure to report and verify those transactions is still under construction). As the reporting regime matures, the IRS's ability to match third-party information returns against taxpayer filings will increase substantially, narrowing the compliance gap that has characterized digital asset taxation since 2014.

The following table summarizes the key implementation dates for broker reporting under TD 10000 and related guidance:

| Requirement | Effective Date | Authority |
|---|---|---|
| Gross proceeds reporting (Form 1099-DA) | Sales on or after January 1, 2025 | TD 10000 |
| Cost basis reporting (covered securities) | Sales on or after January 1, 2026 | TD 10000 |
| Backup withholding relief expires | Calendar year 2027 (TIN match failures) | Notice 2025-33 |
| DeFi broker reporting | Voided by CRA repeal (P.L. 119-7) | TD 10021 (repealed) |
| Section 6050I digital asset cash reporting | Pending implementing regulations | Announcement 2024-4 |

## John Doe Summonses <a href="#john-doe-summonses" id="john-doe-summonses"></a>

The IRS has made aggressive use of John Doe summonses — court-authorized demands for records identifying unnamed taxpayers within a particular class — to compel cryptocurrency exchanges to disclose customer information. These summonses have been a central tool in the agency's effort to identify non-compliant digital asset holders, and the data obtained has fueled the IRS's compliance letter campaigns and examination activity.

### Coinbase (2016-2017) <a href="#coinbase-summons" id="coinbase-summons"></a>

On November 30, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California authorized the IRS to serve a John Doe summons on Coinbase, Inc., seeking records of all Coinbase customers who conducted transactions in convertible virtual currency between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2015. The summons was served on December 8, 2016. Coinbase refused to comply, and the government petitioned to enforce the summons.

After litigation, the court narrowed the scope to 14,355 account holders who had at least $20,000 in any one transaction type (buy, sell, send, or receive) in any one year during 2013-2015. _See_ *United States v. Coinbase, Inc.*, No. 3:17-cv-01431 (N.D. Cal.). Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley granted the enforcement petition on November 28, 2017.

The IRS's rationale rested on stark compliance data: during 2013-2015, only 800 to 900 taxpayers per year filed returns reporting Bitcoin-related transactions, despite Coinbase having over 5.9 million customers and handling over $6 billion in transactions. The disparity between the number of active cryptocurrency users and the number of taxpayers reporting cryptocurrency income was, in the IRS's view, strong circumstantial evidence of widespread non-compliance.

This was the first John Doe summons served on a cryptocurrency exchange and established the legal and practical precedent for subsequent summonses. The Coinbase litigation also produced important judicial discussion of the balance between taxpayer privacy and the government's need to enforce the tax laws — the same tension that would later animate the debate over broker reporting requirements. The customer data obtained from Coinbase contributed directly to the IRS's July 2019 compliance letter campaign targeting over 10,000 taxpayers. IRS, [_IRS Has Begun Sending Letters to Virtual Currency Owners_](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-has-begun-sending-letters-to-virtual-currency-owners-advising-them-to-pay-back-taxes-file-amended-returns-part-of-agencys-larger-efforts) (2019.07.26).

### Kraken (2021-2023) <a href="#kraken-summons" id="kraken-summons"></a>

On May 5, 2021, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California authorized a John Doe summons on Payward Ventures, Inc. d/b/a Kraken, targeting U.S. taxpayers who conducted at least $20,000 in cryptocurrency transactions during 2016-2020. Kraken initially challenged the scope as overbroad.

On June 30, 2023, the court ordered compliance with some limitations on scope. The summons required production of customer names, dates of birth, tax identification numbers, addresses, contact information, and complete transaction histories for the specified period. The breadth of the information demanded — particularly the requirement for complete transaction histories — was significant: it provided the IRS with not only the data needed to identify potentially non-compliant taxpayers, but also the transaction-level detail needed to compute unreported gains and losses.

In October 2023, Kraken notified affected customers that their records would be provided to the IRS in early November 2023. The First Circuit upheld the enforceability of the summons in September 2024, rejecting Kraken's challenge and reinforcing the legal foundation for the IRS's use of John Doe summonses against cryptocurrency exchanges.

### Circle and SFOX (2021-2022) <a href="#circle-sfox-summons" id="circle-sfox-summons"></a>

On April 1, 2021, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts authorized a John Doe summons on Circle Internet Financial, Inc., targeting U.S. taxpayers who conducted at least $20,000 in cryptocurrency transactions through Circle during 2016-2020. U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_Court Authorizes Service of John Doe Summons Seeking the Identities of U.S. Taxpayers Who Have Used Cryptocurrency_](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/court-authorizes-service-john-doe-summons-seeking-identities-us-taxpayers-who-have-used-2) (2021.04.01).

On August 15, 2022, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California authorized a John Doe summons on SFOX, Inc., a cryptocurrency prime dealer headquartered in Los Angeles, targeting U.S. taxpayers who conducted at least $20,000 in transactions with or through SFOX during 2016-2021.

The pattern across all four summonses — Coinbase, Kraken, Circle, and SFOX — demonstrates the IRS's systematic approach to using its information-gathering authority to build a comprehensive picture of cryptocurrency transaction activity across multiple exchanges. Each summons targeted a different segment of the market: Coinbase as the largest retail exchange, Kraken as a major competing exchange, Circle as an issuer and exchange operator, and SFOX as a prime dealer serving institutional and high-net-worth clients. The consistent $20,000 threshold across the later summonses (Kraken, Circle, and SFOX) suggests the IRS has adopted this as a working standard for identifying taxpayers whose transaction volumes are likely to generate reportable income.

The John Doe summons tool will likely diminish in importance as Form 1099-DA reporting takes effect for centralized brokers beginning in 2025. Once exchanges are required to report gross proceeds directly to the IRS, the agency will have access to the same transaction data that it previously needed court authorization to obtain. However, the summons authority remains relevant for exchanges that do not qualify as "brokers" under TD 10000 and for historical periods predating the reporting requirements.

## Criminal Investigations <a href="#criminal-investigations" id="criminal-investigations"></a>

### IRS-CI and Digital Asset Enforcement <a href="#irs-ci" id="irs-ci"></a>

IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) is the law enforcement arm of the IRS and the only federal agency with jurisdiction to investigate federal tax crimes. With approximately 2,000 special agents, IRS-CI has emerged as a principal agency in cryptocurrency-related criminal enforcement, both in tax evasion matters and in the tracing and seizure of illicitly obtained digital assets. The division's role extends beyond tax enforcement: because of its expertise in financial forensics and its statutory authority to investigate money laundering under [18 U.S.C. § 1956](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1956) and [31 U.S.C. § 5332](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5332), IRS-CI is frequently called upon to assist in cryptocurrency investigations led by other agencies.

According to IRS-CI's FY2025 Annual Report, released December 11, 2025, the division identified $10.59 billion in financial crimes, including $4.5 billion in tax fraud — a 111.8% increase from FY2024. IRS, [_IRS-CI FY2025 Annual Report_](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p3583.pdf) (2025.12.11). The division seized over $800 million in assets, obtained $100 million in crime victim restitution, and processed 2.35 petabytes of digital data (a 60% increase from FY2024). The report noted a 25% increase in search warrants and a 14% increase in prosecution referrals to the Department of Justice. [_Id._](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p3583.pdf)

Between FY2018 and FY2023, IRS-CI investigated 390 cases involving digital assets and recommended 224 for prosecution. [_Id._](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p3583.pdf) These figures reflect IRS-CI's increasing investment in blockchain analytics tools, cyber investigation capabilities, and specialized training for agents working digital asset cases. IRS-CI has made significant use of commercial blockchain analytics platforms, which enable investigators to trace the flow of cryptocurrency across addresses, identify patterns of structuring or layering, and link pseudonymous on-chain activity to real-world identities through exchange records, IP addresses, and other digital forensic techniques.

IRS-CI maintains cyber units in multiple field offices and has developed specialized expertise in tracing digital assets across multiple blockchains, including privacy-focused cryptocurrencies that employ obfuscation techniques. The division's capabilities have been recognized by other federal law enforcement agencies, which frequently partner with IRS-CI on cryptocurrency-related investigations even when the underlying criminal conduct is not tax-related.

### Major Cases <a href="#major-cases" id="major-cases"></a>

IRS-CI has been the lead or co-lead agency in several of the largest cryptocurrency seizures and prosecutions in the United States.

**Silk Road / James Zhong.** On November 9, 2021, law enforcement seized approximately 50,676 Bitcoin (then valued at approximately $3.36 billion) from James Zhong. Zhong had exploited a flaw in the Silk Road marketplace's withdrawal system in September 2012, triggering over 140 rapid transactions to steal approximately 50,000 BTC. Zhong pleaded guilty to wire fraud in November 2022 and was sentenced to just over one year in prison in April 2023. U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_U.S. Attorney Announces Historic $3.36 Billion Cryptocurrency Seizure and Conviction_](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/us-attorney-announces-historic-336-billion-cryptocurrency-seizure-and-conviction) (2022.11.07).

**Bitfinex Hack / Lichtenstein & Morgan.** On February 8, 2022, law enforcement arrested Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan and seized approximately $3.6 billion in cryptocurrency (approximately 94,000 BTC) in connection with the 2016 Bitfinex hack, in which $4.5 billion in total was stolen. IRS-CI's Washington, D.C. Field Office Cyber Crimes Unit served as a lead investigative agency alongside the FBI and HSI. Both defendants pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder the proceeds on August 3, 2023. U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_Two Arrested for Alleged Conspiracy to Launder $4.5 Billion in Stolen Cryptocurrency_](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/two-arrested-alleged-conspiracy-launder-45-billion-stolen-cryptocurrency) (2022.02.08).

**Frank Richard Ahlgren III.** In 2024, Frank Richard Ahlgren III became the first person convicted of tax evasion solely for cryptocurrency-related violations. Ahlgren sold approximately $4 million in Bitcoin between 2017 and 2019 without reporting the gains on his tax returns. He was sentenced to two years in federal prison and ordered to pay over $1 million in restitution. The case is notable as a signal that the IRS will pursue standalone cryptocurrency tax evasion cases — not merely cases where cryptocurrency is incidental to other criminal conduct.

**BitMEX.** In January 2025, the cryptocurrency derivatives exchange BitMEX pleaded guilty to criminal violations of the Bank Secrecy Act and agreed to pay a $100 million fine. Its founders received sentences ranging from 12 to 30 months of probation: Arthur Hayes (24 months probation, 6 months home detention), Benjamin Delo (30 months probation), Samuel Reed (18 months probation), and Gregory Dwyer (12 months probation, $150,000 fine). Total penalties, including CFTC civil penalties, exceeded $200 million. _See_ [FinCEN](https://www.thecod3x.com/fincen/) section for additional BSA context.

**Binance / Changpeng Zhao.** In November 2023, Binance agreed to a $4.3 billion settlement with the Department of Justice, and its founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) pleaded guilty to failure to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program. Zhao was sentenced to four months in prison, which he served in 2024. President Trump pardoned Zhao in October 2025. The Binance settlement was the largest criminal resolution involving a cryptocurrency company and involved coordination among multiple agencies, including DOJ, FinCEN, OFAC, and the CFTC. _See_ [FinCEN](https://www.thecod3x.com/fincen/) and [Treasury](https://www.thecod3x.com/treasury/) sections for additional context.

The trajectory of these cases — from the early Silk Road seizure through the Bitfinex recovery and the Ahlgren tax evasion conviction to the Binance institutional settlement — illustrates the maturation of IRS-CI's digital asset enforcement capabilities. Early cases primarily involved tracing and seizing illicitly obtained cryptocurrency; more recent cases have focused on tax evasion, BSA violations, and institutional compliance failures, reflecting a broader enforcement strategy that targets not only individual bad actors but also the platforms that facilitate non-compliant transactions.

### Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement (J5) <a href="#j5" id="j5"></a>

In 2018, the IRS joined the tax enforcement agencies of Australia (Australian Taxation Office), Canada (Canada Revenue Agency), the Netherlands (Dutch Fiscal Information and Investigation Service, or FIOD), and the United Kingdom (His Majesty's Revenue and Customs, or HMRC) to form the Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement (J5). IRS, [_Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement_](https://www.irs.gov/compliance/joint-chiefs-of-global-tax-enforcement).

The J5 leads the fight against international and transnational tax crime, money laundering, and cryptocurrency-facilitated financial crimes. Its activities include:

* Cross-border intelligence sharing on cryptocurrency-facilitated tax evasion
* Joint training on virtual currency tracing, blockchain analysis, and dark web investigations
* Coordinated operations targeting transnational criminal networks using digital assets
* Development of shared analytical tools and methodologies

As of 2024, the J5 had over 30 active high-impact global investigations, each involving two or more member countries. Notable results include the conviction of a government contractor for evading millions in U.S. taxes and the charging of three individuals for roles in a $1.89 billion cryptocurrency fraud scheme. IRS, [_J5 Report_](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-ci/j5-report-7-25-2024.pdf) (2024.07.25).

The J5's significance for the digital asset space lies in its capacity to coordinate enforcement actions across jurisdictions — a capability that is essential given the borderless nature of cryptocurrency transactions. A taxpayer who moves digital assets to a foreign exchange to avoid U.S. reporting requirements may nevertheless be identified through J5 intelligence sharing. The J5's work complements the broader international framework for virtual asset regulation established by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which has promulgated guidance on the regulation of virtual asset service providers (VASPs) and the implementation of the "travel rule" for cryptocurrency transfers. _See_ [FATF](https://www.thecod3x.com/fatf/) section for the international regulatory framework underpinning cooperative enforcement.

## International Reporting <a href="#international-reporting" id="international-reporting"></a>

### FBAR and Virtual Currency <a href="#fbar" id="fbar"></a>

The Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR), filed as FinCEN Report 114 under the Bank Secrecy Act ([31 U.S.C. § 5314](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5314); [31 C.F.R. § 1010.350](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-31/subtitle-B/chapter-X/part-1010/subpart-I/section-1010.350)), requires U.S. persons to report foreign financial accounts with an aggregate value exceeding $10,000 at any time during the calendar year. As of February 2026, cryptocurrency held in foreign accounts is generally not subject to FBAR reporting unless the account also contains other reportable financial assets.

In December 2020, FinCEN published Notice 2020-2, announcing its intention to issue a proposed rulemaking to include virtual currency accounts in FBAR reporting. FinCEN, [_Notice 2020-2_](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/Notice-Virtual%20Currency%20Reporting%20on%20the%20FBAR%20123020.pdf) (2020.12.31). No proposed or final rule has been published as of February 2026. _See_ [FinCEN](https://www.thecod3x.com/fincen/) section for additional discussion.

If a U.S. person holds cryptocurrency on a foreign exchange and the account also holds fiat currency or other reportable financial assets exceeding the $10,000 aggregate threshold, the FBAR filing obligation applies to the entire account, including the cryptocurrency component. FBAR penalties are significant: civil penalties for non-willful violations can reach $10,000 per account per year, and civil penalties for willful violations can reach the greater of $100,000 or 50% of the account balance per year. Criminal penalties may also apply.

The absence of a final rule extending FBAR to cryptocurrency-only foreign accounts creates an ambiguous compliance landscape. Practitioners face the challenge of advising clients who hold digital assets on foreign platforms without clear regulatory guidance on whether FBAR filing is required for those accounts standing alone. The uncertainty is compounded by the severity of FBAR penalties — willful violations can result in penalties of up to 50% of the account balance — which creates pressure toward conservative compliance even absent definitive guidance.

The question of whether a particular foreign platform constitutes a "financial institution" maintaining a "financial account" for FBAR purposes is itself complex. Some foreign exchanges operate more like software platforms than traditional financial institutions, raising questions about whether accounts on those platforms are "financial accounts" within the meaning of [31 C.F.R. § 1010.350](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-31/subtitle-B/chapter-X/part-1010/subpart-I/section-1010.350).

### FATCA Implications <a href="#fatca" id="fatca"></a>

The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), codified at [26 U.S.C. § 6038D](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6038D) and [26 U.S.C. §§ 1471](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1471)--[1474](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1474), requires U.S. taxpayers to report specified foreign financial assets exceeding certain thresholds on Form 8938 (Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets). IRS, [_Summary of FATCA Reporting for U.S. Taxpayers_](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/corporations/summary-of-fatca-reporting-for-us-taxpayers). Reporting thresholds vary by filing status and physical residence:

* Domestic filers (single): $50,000 (end of year) / $75,000 (during year)
* Domestic filers (married filing jointly): higher thresholds apply
* Foreign resident filers (single): $200,000 (end of year) / $300,000 (during year)

The IRS has not issued definitive guidance on whether cryptocurrency held on foreign exchanges constitutes a "specified foreign financial asset" under Section 6038D. However, the broad statutory language — covering "any financial account maintained by a foreign financial institution" — and the policy rationale of FATCA suggest that cryptocurrency accounts on foreign exchanges likely fall within its scope. Conservative compliance practitioners recommend reporting foreign-held cryptocurrency on Form 8938 when thresholds are met, pending definitive IRS guidance. The absence of explicit IRS guidance on this point creates compliance uncertainty, particularly for U.S. persons who hold substantial digital asset positions on exchanges headquartered in jurisdictions such as the Cayman Islands, Singapore, or the Seychelles.

Failure to file Form 8938 carries a $10,000 penalty, with an additional $10,000 for each 30-day period of non-filing after IRS notice, up to a maximum of $50,000. Criminal penalties may also apply.

### Dual Filing Obligations <a href="#dual-filing" id="dual-filing"></a>

Form 8938 (FATCA) does not replace the FBAR requirement (FinCEN Report 114), and vice versa. Taxpayers who meet the thresholds for both filing obligations must file both forms, despite the overlap in the information reported. The two forms are filed with different agencies (Form 8938 is filed with the IRS as an attachment to the income tax return; the FBAR is filed electronically with FinCEN through the BSA E-Filing System) and have different filing deadlines, thresholds, and penalty structures.

The following table summarizes the key differences between the two filing obligations:

| Feature | FBAR (FinCEN Report 114) | FATCA (Form 8938) |
|---|---|---|
| Filing agency | FinCEN (Treasury) | IRS |
| Threshold | $10,000 aggregate (any time during year) | Varies by filing status and residence |
| Filing method | BSA E-Filing System | Attached to income tax return |
| Crypto-only accounts | Generally not required (pending rulemaking) | Uncertain (likely required if thresholds met) |
| Maximum civil penalty (non-willful) | $10,000 per account per year | $10,000 + $10,000 per 30 days (up to $50,000) |

Practitioners advising clients with digital assets on foreign platforms should carefully evaluate both obligations and consider the risk of penalties for non-filing in light of the current regulatory uncertainty.

## Leadership and Funding <a href="#leadership-and-funding" id="leadership-and-funding"></a>

### Commissioner Werfel (2023-2025) <a href="#commissioner-werfel" id="commissioner-werfel"></a>

Daniel Werfel was confirmed as IRS Commissioner on March 9, 2023, by a 54-42 Senate vote for a five-year term that would have expired in 2028. A former acting Commissioner under the Obama administration and private-sector consultant at Boston Consulting Group, Werfel oversaw the most productive period of digital asset rulemaking in IRS history. Under his tenure, the IRS:

* Finalized broker reporting regulations (TD 10000, June 2024)
* Issued the DeFi broker rule (TD 10021, December 2024)
* Published Revenue Ruling 2023-14 on staking rewards (July 2023)
* Published Notice 2023-27 on NFT collectibles (March 2023)
* Published Notice 2023-34 modifying Notice 2014-21 (April 2023)
* Designated digital asset compliance as a priority enforcement area
* Hired two private-sector digital asset experts in February 2024 — Sulolit "Raj" Mukherjee, JD, and Seth Wilks, CPA — as executive advisors for digital assets

IRS, [_IRS Adds Two Key Experts to Focus on Cryptocurrency, Other Digital Assets_](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-adds-two-key-experts-to-focus-on-cryptocurrency-other-digital-assets) (2024.02).

Werfel resigned on January 20, 2025 — Inauguration Day — preempting potential removal by the incoming Trump administration. The timing of his departure left several digital asset initiatives in progress, including the implementation of Form 1099-DA reporting and the ongoing transition relief process. Acting Commissioner Doug O'Donnell served from Werfel's departure until Billy Long's confirmation.

### Commissioner Long and Subsequent Leadership <a href="#commissioner-long" id="commissioner-long"></a>

Billy Long was confirmed as the 51st IRS Commissioner on June 12, 2025 and sworn in on June 16, 2025. A former U.S. Representative for Missouri's 7th Congressional District (2011-2023) and a real estate broker and auctioneer by background, Long departed after approximately two months, having been nominated as ambassador to Iceland. His brief tenure and limited tax experience — including an association with promoting Employee Retention Credit claims that the IRS had flagged as fraud-prone — drew criticism from tax professionals and oversight bodies. The rapid turnover in IRS leadership during 2025 raised questions about the agency's capacity to maintain institutional continuity on complex technical programs, including the digital asset reporting initiative. The departure of the digital asset advisors hired under Werfel's tenure and the broader reduction in IRS workforce under the second Trump administration's cost-cutting initiatives have added further uncertainty to the implementation timeline for digital asset compliance programs.

### Inflation Reduction Act <a href="#ira-funding" id="ira-funding"></a>

The Inflation Reduction Act (P.L. 117-169), enacted August 16, 2022, provided the IRS with approximately $80 billion in additional funding over ten years — representing a roughly 75% increase over the agency's annual operational budget of $12.6 billion. The funding was allocated as follows:

* **Enforcement:** $45.6 billion
* **Operations Support:** $25.3 billion
* **Business Systems Modernization:** $4.75 billion
* **Taxpayer Services:** $3.18 billion

The Act explicitly provides for "digital asset monitoring and compliance activities" as part of IRS enforcement operations — a statutory recognition of the resources required to build and maintain a digital asset tax compliance program. The enforcement allocation, in particular, was expected to fund expanded examination activity, blockchain analytics capabilities, and the development of the Form 1099-DA reporting infrastructure.

Subsequent legislation, including the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 and later appropriations acts, rescinded or redirected approximately $20 billion of the original $80 billion by 2025. The impact of these funding reductions on the IRS's digital asset compliance program remains uncertain, though the development and deployment of Form 1099-DA reporting infrastructure — a multi-year technology project — is particularly sensitive to funding stability.

The intersection of IRS funding and digital asset enforcement is politically significant. Proponents of increased IRS funding argue that the agency's investment in blockchain analytics and information reporting infrastructure will generate significant tax revenue by closing the compliance gap among cryptocurrency holders. Opponents, particularly in the second Trump administration and among congressional Republicans, have sought to reduce IRS funding and enforcement activity more broadly, creating tension with the agency's ambitious digital asset compliance agenda.
