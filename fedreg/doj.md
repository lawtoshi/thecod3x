# 1.50 - Department of Justice (DOJ)

## Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

The U.S. Department of Justice serves as the principal federal authority for criminal enforcement in the digital asset space. While civil regulators such as the [SEC](https://www.thecod3x.com/sec/), [CFTC](https://www.thecod3x.com/cftc/), and [FinCEN](https://www.thecod3x.com/fincen/) bring administrative and civil enforcement actions, the DOJ alone possesses the authority to prosecute federal crimes — including wire fraud (18 U.S.C. Section 1343), money laundering (18 U.S.C. Sections 1956-1957), Bank Secrecy Act violations (31 U.S.C. Section 5331 _et seq._), Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act violations (18 U.S.C. Sections 1961-1968), and sanctions evasion under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. Sections 1701-1706). These statutes form the backbone of DOJ's cryptocurrency enforcement toolkit.

The DOJ's crypto enforcement model follows an investigative-to-prosecutorial pipeline: federal investigative agencies — principally the [FBI](https://www.thecod3x.com/fbi/) and IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) — conduct investigations, develop evidence, and trace cryptocurrency flows, while DOJ prosecutors bring criminal charges. _See_ discussion of the [FBI's](https://www.thecod3x.com/fbi/) investigative role and the [IRS's](https://www.thecod3x.com/irs/) role in crypto tax enforcement. The U.S. Secret Service and Homeland Security Investigations also play significant investigative roles in financial crimes and cybercrime involving digital assets.

From 2021 to 2025, the DOJ dramatically expanded its institutional infrastructure for cryptocurrency enforcement, creating the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET), establishing a Digital Asset Coordinator (DAC) Network of over 150 prosecutors, and securing billions of dollars in penalties and forfeitures. The DOJ obtained the largest corporate criminal penalty in crypto history ($4.3 billion against Binance in November 2023), secured a 25-year prison sentence against FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (March 2024), and executed seizures of forfeited cryptocurrency exceeding $10 billion in aggregate value.

The institutional trajectory shifted sharply in April 2025, when Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche issued the "Ending Regulation by Prosecution" memorandum, which disbanded the NCET, directed certain DOJ units to cease cryptocurrency enforcement, and reoriented DOJ priorities away from regulatory prosecutions and toward cases involving direct victim harm and national security threats. This policy reorientation, combined with executive clemency grants to convicted crypto figures, marked a fundamental change in the DOJ's approach to digital asset enforcement.

This section should be read in conjunction with the treatment of the [SEC](https://www.thecod3x.com/sec/), [CFTC](https://www.thecod3x.com/cftc/), [FinCEN](https://www.thecod3x.com/fincen/), [OFAC](https://www.thecod3x.com/ofac/), [IRS](https://www.thecod3x.com/irs/), and [Executive Actions](https://www.thecod3x.com/exec/), as the DOJ's criminal enforcement frequently runs parallel to those agencies' civil and administrative proceedings.

## Organizational Structure <a href="#organizational-structure" id="organizational-structure"></a>

### Criminal Division <a href="#criminal-division" id="criminal-division"></a>

The Criminal Division of the DOJ has served as the primary organizational home for cryptocurrency enforcement. Under the Biden administration, the Criminal Division was led by Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr. (2021-2023), who oversaw the creation of NCET and the DAC Network, followed by Principal Deputy AAG Nicole M. Argentieri, who served as acting head of the Criminal Division from August 2023 through January 2025. Multiple sections within the Criminal Division have played significant roles in crypto enforcement, as discussed below.

### National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET) (2021-2025) <a href="#ncet" id="ncet"></a>

The NCET was announced on October 6, 2021, by Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco at the Aspen Cyber Summit. U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco Announces National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team_](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/deputy-attorney-general-lisa-o-monaco-announces-national-cryptocurrency-enforcement-team) (2021.10.06). Monaco stated that "[c]ryptocurrency exchanges want to be the banks of the future" and that "we need to make sure that folks can have confidence when they're using these systems and we need to be poised to root out abuse."

The NCET was formally launched on February 17, 2022, with the appointment of Eun Young Choi as its first director. Choi had previously served as senior counsel to the Deputy Attorney General and as cybercrime coordinator at the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York for over nine years. The team was staffed with prosecutors from the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS), the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS), and experts detailed from U.S. Attorneys' Offices across the country. Its mandate encompassed complex investigations and prosecutions of criminal misuses of cryptocurrency, with particular focus on virtual currency exchanges, mixing and tumbling services, and money laundering infrastructure actors. _See_ U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team_](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/national-cryptocurrency-enforcement-team).

Choi served as NCET Director until approximately mid-2023, when she transitioned to the National Security Division as Deputy Assistant Attorney General, reflecting the convergence of cryptocurrency and national security enforcement. Choi subsequently joined Arnold & Porter as a partner in May 2025. After Choi's departure, the NCET continued operating under the Criminal Division until its disbandment on April 7, 2025. _See_ discussion of the Blanche Memo, _infra_.

### Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) <a href="#ccips" id="ccips"></a>

CCIPS has served as a cornerstone of DOJ's cybercrime enforcement, handling ransomware cases, cryptocurrency mixer prosecutions, hacking-for-crypto cases, and sanctions evasion involving digital assets. CCIPS has secured convictions of over 180 cybercriminals since 2020 and obtained court orders for the return of over $350 million in victim funds. _See_ U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_CCIPS Enforcement Actions Fact Sheet_](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-ccips/fact-sheet-ccips-enforcement-actions-combat-cybercrime).

### Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS) <a href="#mlars" id="mlars"></a>

MLARS has prosecuted many of the DOJ's highest-profile cryptocurrency money laundering cases, including the Bitfinex hack laundering prosecution of Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan, the Helix mixer prosecution of Larry Dean Harmon, and the Bitcoin Fog prosecution of Roman Sterlingov. MLARS also manages the DOJ's victim compensation program, which since 2000 has returned more than $12 billion in forfeited assets to victims. _See_ U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_Criminal Division -- Victims_](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-mlars/victims).

### Digital Asset Coordinator (DAC) Network <a href="#dac-network" id="dac-network"></a>

The DAC Network was established in September 2022 alongside the DOJ's report pursuant to Executive Order 14067. The network comprises over 150 federal prosecutors from various U.S. Attorneys' Offices and DOJ litigation departments, serving as a centralized forum for prosecutors to receive training and guidance on investigation and prosecution of criminal activity related to digital assets. _See_ Dechert, [_DOJ Expands Cryptocurrency Enforcement with Formation of Prosecutor Network_](https://www.dechert.com/knowledge/onpoint/2022/9/doj-expands-cryptocurrency-enforcement-with-formation-of-prosecu.html) (2022.09).

### U.S. Attorneys' Offices <a href="#us-attorneys-offices" id="us-attorneys-offices"></a>

Several U.S. Attorneys' Offices have developed particular concentrations of crypto prosecution expertise:

**Southern District of New York (SDNY):** The most prolific crypto-prosecuting office, SDNY has handled FTX/Sam Bankman-Fried, Celsius/Alex Mashinsky, Tornado Cash/Roman Storm, Do Kwon/Terraform Labs, EminiFX/Eddy Alexandre, Samourai Wallet, KuCoin, Coinbase insider trading (Ishan Wahi), and OpenSea insider trading (Nathaniel Chastain), among others.

**Eastern District of New York (EDNY):** Notable cases include Bitzlato/Anatoly Legkodymov and SafeMoon/Braden Karony.

**District of Columbia (D.D.C.):** Handled the Bitfinex hack/Lichtenstein and Morgan prosecution, the Bitcoin Fog/Roman Sterlingov prosecution, and the $263 million social engineering crypto theft ring.

**Western District of Washington:** Managed the Binance/Changpeng Zhao plea agreement.

**Northern District of California:** Led the Hydra Market takedown and handled the BTC-e/Alexander Vinnik prosecution.

**Eastern District of Virginia:** Prosecuted the Garantex case.

**Western District of Texas:** Brought the first criminal crypto tax evasion case against Frank Ahlgren III.

**Northern District of Texas:** Prosecuted REvil ransomware affiliate Yaroslav Vasinskyi.

**Southern District of Florida:** Issued search warrants in the ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware disruption.

**District of Oregon:** Brought the Forsage DeFi Ponzi scheme prosecution.

The concentration of crypto expertise in certain offices — particularly SDNY, which has handled more major crypto prosecutions than any other office — creates practical implications for practitioners. Defendants in crypto cases may face prosecution in jurisdictions with established crypto prosecution track records and specialized knowledge, even when the defendant's connection to that jurisdiction is based solely on the location of victims or the passage of funds through financial institutions within the district.

## Enforcement Policy Evolution <a href="#enforcement-policy-evolution" id="enforcement-policy-evolution"></a>

### Deputy AG Monaco's Enforcement Priorities (October 2021) <a href="#monacos-enforcement-priorities" id="monacos-enforcement-priorities"></a>

Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco was the principal architect of the Biden-era DOJ crypto enforcement infrastructure. In her October 6, 2021 keynote address at the Aspen Cyber Summit, Monaco announced the creation of the NCET and the Civil Cyber-Fraud Initiative, signaling a substantial expansion of federal criminal enforcement against cryptocurrency-facilitated crime. U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco Gives Keynote Address at ABA's 36th National Institute on White Collar Crime_](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/speech/deputy-attorney-general-lisa-o-monaco-gives-keynote-address-abas-36th-national-institute) (2021.10.06).

Monaco's priorities emphasized targeting the infrastructure enabling crypto crime — exchanges, mixers, and money laundering services — rather than solely pursuing individual bad actors. This infrastructure-focused approach would manifest in the Binance, Bitzlato, Bitcoin Fog, and Helix prosecutions. Monaco also announced the appointment of a designated National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team director and the use of cryptocurrency tracing as a standard investigative tool across all DOJ components.

Under Monaco's leadership, the DOJ adopted a "whole-of-government" enforcement posture, coordinating criminal prosecutions with civil regulatory actions by the [SEC](https://www.thecod3x.com/sec/), [CFTC](https://www.thecod3x.com/cftc/), [FinCEN](https://www.thecod3x.com/fincen/), and [OFAC](https://www.thecod3x.com/ofac/). This approach produced the simultaneous multi-agency enforcement actions against Binance in November 2023, the coordinated Bitzlato takedown in January 2023, and the parallel criminal-civil proceedings in the FTX, Celsius, and Terraform cases.

### DOJ Report on Law Enforcement and Digital Assets (September 2022) <a href="#doj-2022-report" id="doj-2022-report"></a>

On September 16, 2022, the DOJ published a 46-page report titled "The Role of Law Enforcement in Detecting, Investigating, and Prosecuting Criminal Activity Related to Digital Assets," as mandated by Section 5(b)(iii) of Executive Order 14067 (signed March 9, 2022, titled "Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets"). _See_ [Executive Actions](https://www.thecod3x.com/exec/).

The report's key recommendations included: (1) expanding the scope of the Bank Secrecy Act to cover additional virtual asset service providers (VASPs); (2) clarifying the application of existing laws to VASPs acting as money services businesses; (3) toughening penalties for violations of BSA registration and reporting requirements; (4) enhancing the DOJ's capacity for blockchain analysis and cryptocurrency tracing; and (5) strengthening international cooperation through bilateral agreements and engagement with multilateral bodies such as the Financial Action Task Force. The report also announced the launch of the DAC Network. _See_ Winston & Strawn, [_The Role of Law Enforcement in Directing, Investigating, and Prosecuting Criminal Activity Related to Digital Assets_](https://www.winston.com/en/blogs-and-podcasts/non-fungible-insights-blockchain-decrypted/the-role-of-law-enforcement-in-directing-investigating-and-prosecuting-criminal-activity-related-to-digital-assets-the-department-of-justice) (2022.09).

Many of the report's legislative recommendations were not enacted during the Biden administration, and the Blanche Memo's April 2025 reorientation effectively rendered several recommendations moot as a matter of DOJ policy, even if the underlying statutory authorities remain available.

### DAG Blanche "Ending Regulation by Prosecution" Memo (April 7, 2025) <a href="#blanche-memo" id="blanche-memo"></a>

On April 7, 2025, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche issued the memorandum titled "Ending Regulation by Prosecution," which represented the most significant single change in DOJ cryptocurrency enforcement policy since the establishment of NCET. U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_Ending Regulation by Prosecution_](https://www.justice.gov/dag/media/1395781/dl) (2025.04.07).

The memorandum described the Biden administration's approach as a "reckless strategy of regulation by prosecution, which was ill conceived and poorly executed." It set forth six key provisions that practitioners should understand:

**First**, the memo declared that "DOJ is not a digital assets regulator." This framing was intended to draw a line between criminal enforcement — which the DOJ retains — and regulatory enforcement, which the memo directed prosecutors to leave to the [SEC](https://www.thecod3x.com/sec/), [CFTC](https://www.thecod3x.com/cftc/), and [FinCEN](https://www.thecod3x.com/fincen/).

**Second**, the memo directed prosecutors not to charge regulatory violations — specifically unlicensed money transmitting, Bank Secrecy Act violations, unregistered securities offerings, unregistered broker-dealer activity, and Commodity Exchange Act registration violations — unless the government can prove willful knowledge of the regulatory requirement. This significantly raised the _mens rea_ threshold for these charges.

**Third**, the memo formally disbanded the NCET, which had been the primary institutional vehicle for coordinated crypto enforcement across DOJ.

**Fourth**, the memo ordered the Market Integrity and Major Frauds (MIMF) Unit within the Fraud Section to cease cryptocurrency enforcement.

**Fifth**, the memo established new enforcement priorities focused on two categories: (a) individual actors who directly victimize investors through embezzlement, scams, rug pulls, hacking, and smart contract exploitation; and (b) use of digital assets to facilitate terrorism, organized crime, narcotics trafficking, and human trafficking.

**Sixth**, the memo directed prosecutors to defer questions about the regulatory framework for digital assets to the appropriate civil regulators rather than attempting to establish regulatory precedent through criminal prosecutions.

_See_ White & Case, [_DOJ Announces Policy "Ending Regulation by Prosecution" of Digital Assets_](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-alert/doj-announces-policy-ending-regulation-prosecution-digital-assets) (2025.04); Covington, [_DOJ Memo Significantly Narrows Digital Asset Prosecution Priorities_](https://www.cov.com/en/news-and-insights/insights/2025/04/doj-memo-significantly-narrows-digital-asset-prosecution-priorities) (2025.04).

The practical effect of the Blanche Memo has been significant but not absolute. Cases involving direct investor fraud (SafeMoon, Do Kwon) and national security threats (Garantex) have continued under the Trump administration, while cases premised primarily on regulatory violations have been deprioritized or abandoned. The memo's heightened _mens rea_ requirement for regulatory charges — demanding proof of willful knowledge of the specific regulatory obligation — is particularly consequential for practitioners, as it effectively eliminates the prosecution of exchange operators or service providers who can plausibly claim ignorance of registration requirements or BSA obligations. Whether this standard will survive future administrations remains an open question, as the memo is a policy directive rather than a statute or regulation.

Practitioners should also note that the Blanche Memo's categories of continued enforcement — investor fraud and national security crimes — remain broad. The SafeMoon conviction in May 2025, the Do Kwon guilty plea in August 2025, and the Garantex prosecution initiated in March 2025 all demonstrate that the DOJ retains substantial enforcement capacity within the memo's framework. The memo's primary effect is to remove the DOJ's role as a _de facto_ regulator of the digital asset industry, not to eliminate criminal enforcement altogether.

### NCET Disbandment <a href="#ncet-disbandment" id="ncet-disbandment"></a>

The NCET was formally disbanded as of April 7, 2025, pursuant to the Blanche Memo. Crypto enforcement responsibility reverted to individual U.S. Attorneys' Offices and remaining Criminal Division sections, with priorities narrowed to investor fraud and national security cases. The disbandment marked the end of a three-and-a-half-year experiment in centralized, coordinated cryptocurrency enforcement.

The practical consequences of the disbandment extend beyond organizational restructuring. The NCET had served as a centralized repository of technical expertise in blockchain analysis, cryptocurrency tracing, and DeFi protocol mechanics. Without a dedicated team, individual U.S. Attorneys' Offices must develop or contract for this expertise independently, potentially leading to inconsistent levels of technical sophistication across districts. The DAC Network, which was not disbanded by the Blanche Memo, may partially fill this gap by continuing to provide training and coordination among federal prosecutors.

The disbandment of the NCET and the concurrent order to the MIMF Unit to cease crypto enforcement should also be understood in the context of broader policy shifts outlined in [Executive Actions](https://www.thecod3x.com/exec/), including Executive Order 14178 ("Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology," signed January 23, 2025), which directed a more industry-friendly approach to digital asset regulation across the federal government.

## Exchange and Platform Prosecutions <a href="#exchange-and-platform-prosecutions" id="exchange-and-platform-prosecutions"></a>

### Binance / Changpeng Zhao <a href="#binance-changpeng-zhao" id="binance-changpeng-zhao"></a>

_United States v. Binance Holdings Limited, d/b/a Binance.com_ (W.D. Wash.)

On November 21, 2023, Binance Holdings Limited pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to violate the Bank Secrecy Act, failure to register as a money transmitting business, and violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Binance agreed to pay $4.3 billion in penalties — one of the largest corporate criminal penalties in DOJ history. The plea agreement required Binance to retain an independent compliance monitor and enhance its AML and sanctions compliance programs. The plea was judicially approved on February 23, 2024. U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_United States v. Binance Holdings Limited_](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/case/united-states-v-binance-holdings-limited-dba-binancecom).

The case was resolved through a multi-agency settlement: [FinCEN](https://www.thecod3x.com/fincen/) assessed a $3.4 billion civil penalty with a five-year monitorship, and [OFAC](https://www.thecod3x.com/ofac/) imposed a $968 million penalty with sanctions compliance obligations. Attorney General Merrick Garland personally delivered remarks at the press conference, stating that the "DOJ will aggressively investigate and prosecute alleged criminal wrongdoing in the financial system." U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_Attorney General Merrick B. Garland Delivers Remarks Announcing Binance and CEO Guilty Pleas_](https://justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-delivers-remarks-announcing-binance-and-ceo-guilty) (2023.11.21).

Binance founder Changpeng Zhao ("CZ") waived indictment and pleaded guilty to willfully violating the BSA on November 21, 2023. On April 30, 2024, Zhao was sentenced to four months in prison and a $50 million fine — substantially below the three-year sentence sought by prosecutors. The sentencing court noted Zhao's cooperation with the government and the significant corporate penalties already imposed. Zhao was released in September 2024 after serving his full sentence. On October 23, 2025, President Trump granted Zhao a full pardon. _See_ discussion of pardons, _infra_.

The Binance prosecution was significant for several reasons beyond its record-breaking penalties. First, it demonstrated the DOJ's capacity to prosecute a foreign-headquartered exchange with no formal U.S. presence by focusing on the exchange's U.S. customer base. Second, the plea agreement's compliance monitorship established a template for DOJ oversight of cryptocurrency exchanges. Third, the multi-agency coordination — with simultaneous enforcement actions by the DOJ, [FinCEN](https://www.thecod3x.com/fincen/), [OFAC](https://www.thecod3x.com/ofac/), and the [CFTC](https://www.thecod3x.com/cftc/) — exemplified the parallel enforcement model that characterized the Biden-era approach to crypto regulation.

Congressional Democrats subsequently wrote to Attorney General Pam Bondi raising concerns that the Trump administration may seek to drop key safeguards in Binance's plea agreement, including the compliance monitorship. _See_ Senate Banking Committee, [_Warren, Hirono, Blumenthal Press DOJ on Trump Administration's Binance Ties_](https://www.banking.senate.gov/newsroom/minority/warren-hirono-blumenthal-press-doj-on-trump-administrations-binance-ties-and-reported-plan-to-drop-key-safeguards-in-companys-43-billion-settlement-and-plea-agreement).

### FTX / Sam Bankman-Fried <a href="#ftx-sam-bankman-fried" id="ftx-sam-bankman-fried"></a>

_United States v. Samuel Bankman-Fried_ (S.D.N.Y.) (Judge Lewis A. Kaplan)

Sam Bankman-Fried, founder and CEO of FTX, was arrested by the Royal Bahamas Police Force in December 2022 following an unsealed indictment in the Southern District of New York. He was extradited to the United States later that month. The original indictment charged eight counts; one was later dropped.

Trial proceeded from October 3 to November 2, 2023, resulting in conviction on all seven remaining counts: two counts of wire fraud, two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. On March 28, 2024, Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and $11 billion in forfeiture. U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_Samuel Bankman-Fried Sentenced to 25 Years for His Orchestration of Multiple Fraudulent Schemes_](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/samuel-bankman-fried-sentenced-25-years-his-orchestration-multiple-fraudulent-schemes) (2024.03.28).

Three FTX cooperators received substantially reduced sentences in exchange for their testimony. Caroline Ellison, former CEO of Alameda Research, pleaded guilty and testified at trial regarding the misuse of customer funds and the close financial relationship between FTX and Alameda. She was sentenced on September 24, 2024 to two years in prison and $11 billion in forfeiture. Gary Wang, FTX co-founder and the exchange's principal architect, pleaded guilty, testified at trial, and received no prison time due to what prosecutors described as exceptional cooperation — calling him the "easiest cooperator" they had worked with. Nishad Singh, former engineering director, pleaded guilty, testified at trial, and received no prison time with three years of supervised release.

The FTX prosecution represented the largest cryptocurrency fraud case in DOJ history and was significant for several reasons beyond its scale. First, the speed of the prosecution — from arrest to conviction in under one year — demonstrated the DOJ's capacity for rapid, large-scale crypto fraud cases. Second, the cooperator strategy, in which three senior FTX executives testified against Bankman-Fried, exemplified the DOJ's approach of building cases through insider cooperation. Third, the 25-year sentence established a benchmark for penalties in major crypto fraud cases, although it fell below the potential maximum of 110 years.

The [SEC](https://www.thecod3x.com/sec/) brought parallel civil charges, and the [CFTC](https://www.thecod3x.com/cftc/) obtained a $12.7 billion judgment — comprising $8.7 billion in restitution and $4 billion in disgorgement.

### BitMEX / Hayes, Delo, and Reed <a href="#bitmex" id="bitmex"></a>

_United States v. Arthur Hayes et al._, No. 20-cr-500 (S.D.N.Y.)

In October 2020, the DOJ and [CFTC](https://www.thecod3x.com/cftc/) brought charges against BitMEX and its founders — Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, and Samuel Reed — for violating the Bank Secrecy Act by operating a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange without adequate AML controls while allowing U.S. customers to trade.

Hayes and Delo pleaded guilty to violating the BSA on February 24, 2022. Hayes was sentenced on May 20, 2022 to two years of probation and six months of home detention. Delo was sentenced on June 15, 2022 to 30 months of probation and a $10 million fine. Reed pleaded guilty and was sentenced similarly. The [CFTC](https://www.thecod3x.com/cftc/) ordered BitMEX to pay $30 million in a parallel civil action. _See_ CFTC, [_Press Release_](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8522-22) (2022.05.13).

On March 28, 2025, President Trump granted full pardons to Hayes, Delo, and Reed. _See_ discussion of pardons, _infra_.

### Bitzlato / Legkodymov <a href="#bitzlato" id="bitzlato"></a>

_United States v. Anatoly Legkodymov_ (E.D.N.Y.)

On January 17, 2023, Anatoly Legkodymov, the founder and majority owner of Bitzlato, was arrested in Miami as part of a coordinated international takedown. Deputy Attorney General Monaco announced the action, emphasizing that Bitzlato processed over $700 million in illicit funds and that its largest counterparty was the Hydra darknet marketplace. U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco Delivers Remarks on Founder and Majority Owner of Bitzlato_](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/speech/deputy-attorney-general-lisa-o-monaco-delivers-remarks-founder-and-majority-owner) (2023.01.18).

Legkodymov was charged with operating an unlicensed money services business. He pleaded guilty on December 6, 2023 and agreed to dissolve Bitzlato and forfeit approximately $23 million in seized assets. U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_Founder and Majority Owner of Cryptocurrency Exchange Pleads Guilty to Unlicensed Money Transmitting_](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/founder-and-majority-owner-cryptocurrency-exchange-pleads-guilty-unlicensed-money) (2023.12.06).

### KuCoin <a href="#kucoin" id="kucoin"></a>

_United States v. Peken Global Limited d/b/a KuCoin et al._ (S.D.N.Y.)

A four-count indictment against KuCoin (as Peken Global Limited) and its founders Chun Gan and Ke Tang was unsealed on March 26, 2024, charging operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business, violating the BSA, and failure to implement AML/KYC programs. The indictment alleged that KuCoin processed over $9 billion in illicit transactions between 2017 and 2024.

On January 27, 2025, KuCoin pleaded guilty to one count of operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business and agreed to pay $297.4 million in total penalties ($184.5 million in criminal forfeiture and $112.9 million in criminal fine). KuCoin also agreed to exit the U.S. market for at least two years. Founders Gan and Tang entered deferred prosecution agreements for two years and agreed to forfeit approximately $2.7 million each. U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_KuCoin Pleads Guilty to Unlicensed Money Transmission Charge and Agrees to Pay Penalties_](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/kucoin-pleads-guilty-unlicensed-money-transmission-charge-and-agrees-pay-penalties) (2025.01.27).

### Bitcoin Fog / Roman Sterlingov <a href="#bitcoin-fog" id="bitcoin-fog"></a>

_United States v. Roman Sterlingov_ (D.D.C.)

Roman Sterlingov operated Bitcoin Fog, the longest-running cryptocurrency mixer on the darknet, from 2011 to 2021. Bitcoin Fog processed over 1.2 million bitcoin (approximately $400 million at the time of the transactions). Following a one-month trial in February and March 2024, Sterlingov was convicted of money laundering conspiracy, money laundering, operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, and money transmission without a license. U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_Bitcoin Fog Operator Convicted of Money Laundering Conspiracy_](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/bitcoin-fog-operator-convicted-money-laundering-conspiracy) (2024.03).

On November 8, 2024, Sterlingov was sentenced to 12 years and six months in prison. The court imposed a money judgment of $395,563,025.39 and ordered forfeiture of approximately 1,345 bitcoin (approximately $103 million) and additional seized assets of approximately $1.76 million. U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_Bitcoin Fog Operator Sentenced for Money Laundering Conspiracy_](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/bitcoin-fog-operator-sentenced-money-laundering-conspiracy) (2024.11.08).

### Helix / Larry Dean Harmon <a href="#helix" id="helix"></a>

_United States v. Larry Dean Harmon_ (D.D.C.)

Larry Dean Harmon operated Helix, a cryptocurrency mixing service, from 2014 to 2017. Helix processed over 354,468 bitcoin (approximately $311 million at the time of the transactions) and was a primary mixing service used by darknet drug dealers. Harmon pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering on August 18, 2021. In November 2024, he was sentenced to 36 months in prison and three years of supervised release. The court imposed a money judgment of $311,145,854 and ordered forfeiture of seized assets valued at over $400 million, finalized in January 2026. U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_Operator of Helix Darknet Cryptocurrency Mixer Sentenced for Money Laundering Conspiracy_](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/operator-helix-darknet-cryptocurrency-mixer-sentenced-money-laundering-conspiracy-and) (2024.11).

[FinCEN](https://www.thecod3x.com/fincen/) assessed a $60 million civil monetary penalty against Harmon in a parallel administrative action.

### Samourai Wallet <a href="#samourai-wallet" id="samourai-wallet"></a>

_United States v. Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill_ (S.D.N.Y.)

In April 2024, the DOJ seized the domain and servers of Samourai Wallet, a cryptocurrency mixing service, with assistance from Icelandic authorities. Rodriguez and Hill, the founders, were charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. The government alleged that Samourai Wallet facilitated over $237 million in illegal transactions, including proceeds from drug trafficking, darknet markets, cyber-intrusions, sanctioned jurisdictions, and other serious crimes.

### Garantex <a href="#garantex" id="garantex"></a>

_United States v. Aleksandr Mira Serda and Aleksej Besciokov_ (E.D. Va.)

On March 7, 2025, the DOJ unsealed an indictment against two administrators of Garantex, a Russia-linked cryptocurrency exchange. Serda and Besciokov were charged with money laundering conspiracy; Besciokov was additionally charged with conspiracy to violate IEEPA and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. Besciokov was arrested in India following the unsealing.

The U.S. Secret Service, working with German and Finnish law enforcement, seized Garantex's web domain and froze over $26 million in cryptocurrency. The government alleged that Garantex processed over $100 million in transactions linked to illicit activities since 2019, including for ransomware actors and cybercriminals. [OFAC](https://www.thecod3x.com/ofac/) simultaneously re-designated Garantex Europe OU.

The Garantex prosecution is notable as one of the first major crypto enforcement actions initiated under the Trump administration, demonstrating that the Blanche Memo's narrowing of enforcement priorities did not preclude national security and sanctions evasion cases.

### Celsius / Alex Mashinsky <a href="#celsius-alex-mashinsky" id="celsius-alex-mashinsky"></a>

_United States v. Alexander Mashinsky_ (S.D.N.Y.)

Alexander Mashinsky, founder and former CEO of Celsius Network, was arrested in July 2023 and charged with commodities fraud and securities fraud. The charges arose from two alleged schemes: (1) misleading Celsius customers about the company's profitability and investment practices, and (2) illicitly manipulating the price of the CEL token while secretly selling his own holdings. Celsius held approximately $25 billion in assets at its peak in fall 2021.

On December 3, 2024, Mashinsky pleaded guilty to one count of commodities fraud and one count of securities fraud. On May 8, 2025, he was sentenced to 12 years in prison — below the 20-year term sought by prosecutors — and ordered to forfeit over $48 million.

The [SEC](https://www.thecod3x.com/sec/) brought parallel civil charges.

### Terraform Labs / Do Kwon <a href="#terraform-labs-do-kwon" id="terraform-labs-do-kwon"></a>

_United States v. Do Kwon_ (S.D.N.Y.) (Judge Paul A. Engelmayer)

Do Kwon, co-founder of Terraform Labs, was arrested on March 23, 2023 in Montenegro while allegedly attempting to travel on a fraudulent passport. After protracted extradition proceedings, Kwon was extradited to the United States on December 31, 2024. U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_Do Kwon Extradited to United States from Montenegro to Face Charges Relating to Fraud Resulting in $40B in Losses_](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/do-kwon-extradited-united-states-montenegro-face-charges-relating-fraud-resulting-40b-losses) (2024.12.31).

In August 2025, Kwon pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, securities fraud, and wire fraud, and one count of wire fraud. U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_Do Kwon Pleads Guilty to Fraud_](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/do-kwon-pleads-guilty-fraud) (2025.08).

Kwon's schemes — orchestrated from 2018 to 2022 through Terraform's cryptocurrencies TerraUSD (UST) and LUNA — resulted in approximately $40 billion in investor losses. The [SEC](https://www.thecod3x.com/sec/) obtained a $4.5 billion civil judgment in a parallel action.

### Mango Markets / Avraham Eisenberg <a href="#mango-markets" id="mango-markets"></a>

_United States v. Avraham Eisenberg_, No. 23-cr-10 (S.D.N.Y.)

Avraham Eisenberg was charged with commodities fraud, commodities market manipulation, and wire fraud for allegedly obtaining approximately $110 million from Mango Markets, a decentralized finance platform, by manipulating the price of MNGO perpetual futures. He was convicted by a federal jury in April 2024 in what the DOJ described as the first-ever cryptocurrency open-market manipulation case. U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_Man Convicted in $110M Cryptocurrency Scheme_](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/man-convicted-110m-cryptocurrency-scheme) (2024.04).

Post-trial, the court vacated counts one and two and entered a judgment of acquittal on count three based on venue issues. A retrial may be ordered. Eisenberg was separately sentenced to 52 months in prison in May 2025 in connection with an unrelated criminal matter.

### EminiFX / Eddy Alexandre <a href="#eminifx" id="eminifx"></a>

_United States v. Eddy Alexandre_ (S.D.N.Y.)

Eddy Alexandre, CEO of EminiFX, solicited over $248 million from more than 25,000 investors with promises of 5% weekly returns through automated cryptocurrency and forex trading. In reality, Alexandre did not invest most of the funds and diverted $14.7 million to personal accounts for luxury purchases. Alexandre pleaded guilty to commodities fraud in February 2023 and was sentenced in July 2023 to nine years in prison and three years of supervised release, with $248,829,276.73 in forfeiture and $213,639,133.53 in restitution (later increased to $228 million by court order).

### BitConnect <a href="#bitconnect" id="bitconnect"></a>

BitConnect operated as a $2.4 billion Ponzi scheme affecting 4,154 victims across 95 countries. Founder Satish Kumbhani was indicted in February 2022 on federal charges including money laundering and fraud; he is believed to have fled India and remains a fugitive. Glenn Arcaro, the top U.S. promoter, pleaded guilty in September 2021 and was sentenced on September 16, 2022 to 38 months in prison, with orders to forfeit $24 million and pay $17 million in restitution to approximately 800 victims. U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_BitConnect Founder Indicted in Global $2.4 Billion Cryptocurrency Scheme_](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/bitconnect-founder-indicted-global-24-billion-cryptocurrency-scheme) (2022.02).

### Ponzi Schemes and Other Fraud <a href="#ponzi-schemes-and-other-fraud" id="ponzi-schemes-and-other-fraud"></a>

**OneCoin / Ruja Ignatova:** Ignatova, known as the "Cryptoqueen," allegedly orchestrated a $4 billion fraud affecting approximately 3.5 million victims worldwide. She remains a fugitive and was placed on the FBI's Top 10 Most Wanted list with a $5 million reward. Co-founder Karl Sebastian Greenwood was sentenced in September 2023 to 20 years in prison with $300 million in forfeiture. Ruja's brother, Konstantin Ignatov, received time served in March 2024 after pleading guilty and cooperating. Compliance chief Irina Dilkinska was sentenced in April 2024 to four years in prison for money laundering and wire fraud.

**IcomTech:** This purported cryptocurrency mining and trading company, started in approximately 2018, promised investors they would double their money within six months. No actual mining or trading occurred. Founder David Carmona pleaded guilty and was sentenced on October 4, 2024 to 121 months (approximately 10 years) in prison. U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_Founder of Cryptocurrency Ponzi Scheme IcomTech Sentenced to 121 Months in Prison_](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/founder-cryptocurrency-ponzi-scheme-icomtech-sentenced-121-months-prison) (2024.10.04). CEO Marco Ruiz Ochoa pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five years in prison.

**SafeMoon / Braden John Karony:** _United States v. Braden John Karony_ (E.D.N.Y.). After a 12-day trial in May 2025, Karony was convicted on all three counts: conspiracy to commit securities fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering. SafeMoon's market capitalization had grown to over $8 billion. Karony and co-conspirators allegedly lied to investors about access to the "liquidity pool" and diverted millions for personal use. Co-conspirator Thomas Smith pleaded guilty; co-conspirator Kyle Nagy remains at large. Karony faces up to 45 years in prison. The SafeMoon prosecution continued after the April 2025 Blanche Memo, illustrating that investor fraud cases remain within DOJ's enforcement priorities.

**Forsage:** The DOJ indicted four Russian founders — Vladimir Okhotnikov, Olena Oblamska, Mikhail Sergeev, and Sergey Maslakov — on conspiracy to commit wire fraud for operating what was marketed as a decentralized DeFi platform but functioned as a Ponzi and pyramid scheme. Forsage raised approximately $340 million from victim-investors; over 80% of investors received fewer ETH back than they invested, and over 50% never received any payout. The prosecution represented the first criminal charges associated with a DeFi Ponzi scheme. The [SEC](https://www.thecod3x.com/sec/) charged 11 individuals in a parallel civil action.

### NFT and Market Manipulation <a href="#nft-and-market-manipulation" id="nft-and-market-manipulation"></a>

**OpenSea / Nathaniel Chastain:** _United States v. Nathaniel Chastain_ (S.D.N.Y.). Chastain, OpenSea's former head of product, was charged with wire fraud and money laundering — the first-ever digital asset insider trading scheme — for using advance knowledge of homepage NFT features to purchase NFTs before they were publicly featured. He was convicted in May 2023 and sentenced in August 2023 to three months in prison. U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_Former Employee of NFT Marketplace Sentenced in First-Ever Digital Asset Insider Trading Scheme_](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-employee-nft-marketplace-sentenced-prison-first-ever-digital-asset-insider) (2023.08). The Second Circuit vacated the conviction, ruling that confidential business information must have commercial value to the company to qualify as "property" under the wire fraud statute. In January 2026, the DOJ formally dropped the case through a one-month deferred prosecution agreement.

**Coinbase / Ishan Wahi:** _United States v. Ishan Wahi et al._ (S.D.N.Y.) (Judge Loretta A. Preska). In the first-ever cryptocurrency insider trading case, Wahi, a Coinbase product manager, was charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud for providing confidential token listing information to his brother Nikhil Wahi and friend Sameer Ramani, who made over $1 million trading ahead of announcements from June 2021 to April 2022. Ishan Wahi pleaded guilty and was sentenced on May 9, 2023 to two years in prison. U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_Former Coinbase Insider Sentenced in First-Ever Cryptocurrency Insider Trading Case_](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-coinbase-insider-sentenced-first-ever-cryptocurrency-insider-trading-case) (2023.05.09).

**Hydrogen Technology:** _United States v. Shane Hampton et al._ (S.D.N.Y.). Shane Hampton orchestrated manipulation of the HYDRO token using an automated trading bot, executing approximately $7 million in wash trades and over $300 million in spoof trades from October 2018 to April 2019. CEO Michael Kane was sentenced to three years and nine months; Hampton was convicted at trial and sentenced to two years and 11 months; Tyler Ostern, CEO of the South Africa-based bot operator Moonwalkers Trading Limited, was sentenced to two years. U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_Man Convicted in $300M Securities Price Manipulation and Wire Fraud Cryptocurrency Conspiracy_](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/man-convicted-300m-securities-price-manipulation-and-wire-fraud-cryptocurrency-conspiracy). This case was the first criminal jury trial in which a cryptocurrency was found to be a security.

## Mixer and Privacy Protocol Cases <a href="#mixer-and-privacy-protocol-cases" id="mixer-and-privacy-protocol-cases"></a>

### Tornado Cash / Roman Storm and Roman Semenov <a href="#tornado-cash" id="tornado-cash"></a>

_United States v. Roman Storm and Roman Semenov_ (S.D.N.Y.)

On August 23, 2023, the DOJ unsealed an indictment charging Storm and Semenov, co-founders of the Tornado Cash cryptocurrency mixer, with conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, and conspiracy to commit sanctions violations under IEEPA. U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_Tornado Cash Founders Charged with Money Laundering and Sanctions Violations_](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/tornado-cash-founders-charged-money-laundering-and-sanctions-violations) (2023.08.23). The government alleged that Tornado Cash facilitated more than $1 billion in money laundering, including hundreds of millions of dollars for the Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-sponsored hacking organization.

Storm's motion to dismiss was denied on September 26, 2024. The four-week trial proceeded in July and August 2025 and produced a mixed verdict on August 6, 2025: Storm was convicted of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, but the jury deadlocked on the two more serious charges — money laundering conspiracy and sanctions violations conspiracy.

The mixed verdict may reflect several factors, including the shifting enforcement environment under the Blanche Memo, the complexity of applying traditional criminal statutes to decentralized protocols, and the Fifth Circuit's November 2024 ruling in a separate [OFAC](https://www.thecod3x.com/ofac/) case holding that OFAC overstepped its authority by sanctioning Tornado Cash smart contracts. _See_ discussion of Tornado Cash at [OFAC](https://www.thecod3x.com/ofac/).

The Tornado Cash prosecution raises fundamental questions about the application of criminal money transmitting and money laundering statutes to developers of non-custodial, decentralized software protocols. Unlike custodial mixers such as Helix and Bitcoin Fog — where operators maintained control over users' funds during the mixing process — Tornado Cash operated through immutable smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The Storm trial tested whether deploying and maintaining such software constitutes "operating" an unlicensed money transmitting business, a question with potentially far-reaching implications for software developers in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Semenov, a Russian national, remains at large as of February 2026.

## Ransomware Prosecutions <a href="#ransomware-prosecutions" id="ransomware-prosecutions"></a>

Ransomware prosecutions represent a significant intersection of cryptocurrency and cybercrime enforcement. In virtually all modern ransomware attacks, threat actors demand payment in cryptocurrency — typically Bitcoin or privacy-focused coins — making blockchain analysis and crypto seizure central to the DOJ's ransomware strategy. The DOJ's approach to ransomware has evolved from reactive prosecution of individual attackers to proactive disruption of ransomware infrastructure, including the seizure of servers, decryption key distribution to victims, and cryptocurrency wallet seizures. Notably, the Blanche Memo did not curtail DOJ ransomware enforcement, as these cases fall squarely within the memo's continued priority on crimes involving direct victim harm and national security threats.

### Colonial Pipeline / DarkSide Recovery <a href="#colonial-pipeline" id="colonial-pipeline"></a>

On May 7, 2021, the DarkSide ransomware group attacked Colonial Pipeline, the largest fuel pipeline in the United States. Colonial Pipeline paid 75 bitcoin (approximately $4.4 million) in ransom. On May 28, 2021, the FBI seized 63.7 bitcoin (approximately $2.3 million, reflecting Bitcoin's price decline) from the DarkSide affiliate's Bitcoin wallet. The recovery was announced by the DOJ on June 7, 2021. U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_Department of Justice Seizes $2.3 Million in Cryptocurrency Paid to Ransomware Extortionists DarkSide_](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/department-justice-seizes-23-million-cryptocurrency-paid-ransomware-extortionists-darkside) (2021.06.07).

The Colonial Pipeline recovery was significant in demonstrating federal law enforcement's ability to trace and recover cryptocurrency ransomware payments, challenging the perception that cryptocurrency payments to ransomware operators were unrecoverable. The seizure was executed through a judicially authorized warrant, with the FBI able to identify and access the specific Bitcoin wallet holding the ransom proceeds. The operation illustrated that while cryptocurrency provides pseudonymity, it does not provide immunity from law enforcement, particularly when ransom payments can be traced on public blockchains.

### Hive Ransomware Takedown <a href="#hive-ransomware" id="hive-ransomware"></a>

On January 26, 2023, the DOJ announced the disruption of the Hive ransomware variant. Beginning in July 2022, the [FBI](https://www.thecod3x.com/fbi/) had gained clandestine, persistent access to Hive's control panel, which enabled it to provide decryption keys to 336 victims and prevent approximately $130 million in ransom payments. The FBI ultimately seized Hive's leak site and victim negotiation portal. Hive had targeted more than 1,500 victims in over 80 countries. The operation was conducted jointly with the German Federal Criminal Police (BKA) and Dutch law enforcement. _See_ U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_U.S. Department of Justice Disrupts Hive Ransomware Variant_](https://www.justice.gov/opa/video/us-department-justice-disrupts-hive-ransomware-variant) (2023.01.26).

### ALPHV/BlackCat Disruption <a href="#alphv-blackcat" id="alphv-blackcat"></a>

On December 19, 2023, the DOJ announced the disruption of the ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware variant, which had been the second most prolific ransomware-as-a-service variant globally, targeting over 1,000 victims. The [FBI](https://www.thecod3x.com/fbi/) developed a decryption tool and offered it to over 500 affected victims, saving an estimated $68 million in ransom demands. Websites were seized via search warrants in the Southern District of Florida. The operation involved the FBI, Europol, and authorities from Germany, Denmark, Australia, Spain, the United Kingdom, Austria, and Switzerland. U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_Justice Department Disrupts Prolific ALPHV/BlackCat Ransomware Variant_](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-disrupts-prolific-alphvblackcat-ransomware-variant) (2023.12.19). Two Americans subsequently pleaded guilty to targeting U.S. victims using the ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware.

### LockBit / Operation Cronos <a href="#lockbit" id="lockbit"></a>

On February 20, 2024, the DOJ announced a major international law enforcement operation — "Operation Cronos" — against LockBit, which had been the most deployed ransomware variant worldwide for four years, targeting over 2,000 victims and receiving more than $120 million in ransom payments. The operation involved seizure of 34 servers across Europe, the United Kingdom, and the United States, along with over 200 cryptocurrency wallets. The DOJ unsealed indictments against Russian nationals Artur Sungatov and Ivan Kondratyev. In May 2024, the LockBit leader was identified as Dmitry Yuryevich Khoroshev, a Russian national. U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_U.S. and UK Disrupt LockBit Ransomware Variant_](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/us-and-uk-disrupt-lockbit-ransomware-variant) (2024.02.20). The operation was conducted with the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA), the FBI, and Europol.

### REvil <a href="#revil" id="revil"></a>

_United States v. Yaroslav Vasinskyi_ (N.D. Tex.)

Yaroslav Vasinskyi, a 24-year-old Ukrainian national, was arrested in Poland and extradited to the United States in March 2022 for his role in the REvil/Sodinokibi ransomware operation. Vasinskyi participated in over 2,500 ransomware attacks demanding over $700 million in total, including the July 2021 Kaseya attack that infected up to 1,500 businesses. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud and related activity in connection with computers, damage to protected computers, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. He was sentenced to 13 years and seven months in prison with more than $16 million in restitution. U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_Sodinokibi/REvil Affiliate Sentenced for Role in $700M Ransomware Scheme_](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/sodinokibirevil-affiliate-sentenced-role-700m-ransomware-scheme).

In a separate ransomware prosecution, the DOJ unsealed indictments in September 2023 against multiple individuals connected to the Conti ransomware group in the Middle District of Tennessee. Conti targeted over 1,000 victims in 47 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and 31 countries, with the FBI estimating over $150 million in ransom payments as of January 2022. In October 2025, Ukrainian national Oleksii Oleksiyovych Lytvynenko was extradited from Ireland and charged with computer fraud conspiracy and wire fraud conspiracy for deploying Conti ransomware from 2020 to 2022. U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_Ukrainian National Extradited from Ireland in Connection with Conti Ransomware_](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/ukrainian-national-extradited-ireland-connection-conti-ransomware) (2025.10).

## Darknet Marketplace Prosecutions <a href="#darknet-marketplace-prosecutions" id="darknet-marketplace-prosecutions"></a>

Darknet marketplaces represent some of the earliest and most significant intersections of cryptocurrency and criminal activity. Bitcoin's pseudonymous properties made it the default payment mechanism for darknet markets beginning with Silk Road in 2011. The DOJ's prosecution of darknet marketplace operators has evolved from targeting individual platform operators to conducting large-scale international takedown operations involving server seizures and coordinated arrests across multiple jurisdictions.

### Silk Road / Ross Ulbricht <a href="#silk-road" id="silk-road"></a>

_United States v. Ross William Ulbricht_ (S.D.N.Y.)

Ross Ulbricht created and operated Silk Road, the first modern darknet marketplace, from January 2011 to October 2013. The platform enabled thousands of drug dealers to serve over 100,000 buyers, with hundreds of millions of dollars laundered through Bitcoin transactions. Following a four-week jury trial in January and February 2015, Ulbricht was convicted on February 5, 2015 on all seven counts: distributing narcotics, distributing narcotics by means of the Internet, conspiring to distribute narcotics, engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, conspiring to commit computer hacking, conspiring to traffic in false identity documents, and conspiring to commit money laundering.

On May 29, 2015, Judge Katherine B. Forrest sentenced Ulbricht to life in prison without the possibility of parole. U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_Ross Ulbricht, a/k/a "Dread Pirate Roberts," Sentenced in Manhattan Federal Court to Life in Prison_](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/ross-ulbricht-aka-dread-pirate-roberts-sentenced-manhattan-federal-court-life-prison) (2015.05.29). The conviction was affirmed by the Second Circuit on appeal. On January 21, 2025, President Trump granted Ulbricht a full and unconditional pardon. _See_ discussion of pardons, _infra_.

### Silk Road Bitcoin Theft / James Zhong <a href="#silk-road-bitcoin-theft" id="silk-road-bitcoin-theft"></a>

_United States v. James Zhong_ (S.D.N.Y.)

On November 9, 2021, federal agents seized approximately 50,676 bitcoin (valued at $3.36 billion) from James Zhong's home in Gainesville, Georgia — at the time, the largest cryptocurrency seizure in DOJ history. Zhong had exploited an error in Silk Road's withdrawal system in September 2012, creating nine accounts and triggering over 140 rapid transactions to extract approximately 50,000 bitcoin. Zhong pleaded guilty to wire fraud and was sentenced on April 14, 2023 to one year and one day in prison. The court ordered forfeiture of 51,680.32473733 bitcoin, valued at over $3.4 billion at the time of seizure. U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_U.S. Attorney Announces Historic $3.36 Billion Cryptocurrency Seizure and Conviction_](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/us-attorney-announces-historic-336-billion-cryptocurrency-seizure-and-conviction) (2022.11.07).

### Hydra Market Takedown <a href="#hydra-market" id="hydra-market"></a>

On April 5, 2022, the DOJ announced the takedown of Hydra Market, the world's largest darknet marketplace, in a joint operation with the German Federal Criminal Police (BKA). Hydra was a Russian-language marketplace that had operated since 2015 and accounted for an estimated 80% of all darknet market cryptocurrency transactions in 2021, receiving approximately $5.2 billion in cryptocurrency since inception.

The operation involved the seizure of Germany-based servers and $25 million in bitcoin. Dmitry Olegovich Pavlov, a 30-year-old Russian national, was indicted in the Northern District of California and charged with conspiracy to distribute narcotics and conspiracy to commit money laundering. U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_Justice Department Investigation Leads to Shutdown of Largest Online Darknet Marketplace_](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/justice-department-investigation-leads-shutdown-largest-online-darknet-marketplace) (2022.04.05). [OFAC](https://www.thecod3x.com/ofac/) simultaneously designated Hydra and the Garantex exchange.

## Sanctions Evasion and State-Sponsored Threats <a href="#sanctions-evasion-and-state-sponsored-threats" id="sanctions-evasion-and-state-sponsored-threats"></a>

### North Korea / Lazarus Group <a href="#north-korea-lazarus-group" id="north-korea-lazarus-group"></a>

In February 2021, the DOJ unsealed an indictment charging three North Korean military hackers — Jon Chang Hyok, Kim Il, and Park Jin Hyok — with a wide-ranging scheme involving cyberattacks and financial crimes, including cryptocurrency theft. U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_Three North Korean Military Hackers Indicted in Wide-Ranging Scheme to Commit Cyberattacks and Financial Crimes_](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/three-north-korean-military-hackers-indicted-wide-ranging-scheme-commit-cyberattacks-and) (2021.02).

The scale of DPRK-linked cryptocurrency theft has been substantial: DPRK-linked groups stole over $200 million in cryptocurrency in 2023 alone and approximately $1.3 billion across 47 incidents in 2024. Notable thefts attributed to the Lazarus Group include the $41 million theft from Stake.com in September 2023 and the Harmony Horizon Bridge theft. The DOJ has seized more than $15 million in cryptocurrency stolen by the Lazarus Group from four platforms in 2023. In October 2024, the DOJ filed a civil forfeiture action seeking to recover $2.67 million stolen by the Lazarus Group.

North Korean crypto theft represents a direct national security concern, as stolen funds are believed to support the DPRK's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. The intersection of the Lazarus Group's activities with the Tornado Cash mixer prosecution illustrates how cryptocurrency enforcement crosses traditional boundaries between criminal law, national security, and sanctions enforcement. The DOJ's National Security Division, which housed former NCET Director Eun Young Choi from 2023 to 2025, has played an increasingly central role in these cases.

The DOJ's approach to North Korean crypto theft is necessarily distinct from its approach to other cryptocurrency crimes, as the defendants are typically foreign state actors beyond the practical reach of criminal prosecution. The DOJ has accordingly relied heavily on civil forfeiture actions — filing _in rem_ claims against the stolen cryptocurrency itself — and on coordination with [OFAC](https://www.thecod3x.com/ofac/) sanctions designations to freeze assets and disrupt laundering channels. _See_ [OFAC](https://www.thecod3x.com/ofac/) for additional discussion of sanctions designations related to North Korean cyber actors.

### Iran Sanctions Evasion Cases <a href="#iran-sanctions-evasion" id="iran-sanctions-evasion"></a>

In May 2022, the DOJ launched its first criminal prosecution involving the alleged use of cryptocurrency to evade U.S. sanctions, charging an American citizen who transmitted more than $10 million in bitcoin to an exchange in a comprehensively sanctioned country. Iranian crypto activity has been estimated at $8-10 billion annually.

[OFAC](https://www.thecod3x.com/ofac/) designated two UK-registered cryptocurrency exchanges — Zedcex Exchange Ltd. and Zedxion Exchange Ltd. — on January 30, 2026 for facilitating transactions for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), marking the first-ever designation of IRGC-linked digital asset exchanges. _See_ discussion at [OFAC](https://www.thecod3x.com/ofac/).

## Tax Evasion <a href="#tax-evasion" id="tax-evasion"></a>

### Frank Ahlgren III <a href="#frank-ahlgren-iii" id="frank-ahlgren-iii"></a>

_United States v. Frank Richard Ahlgren III_ (W.D. Tex.)

Frank Ahlgren III was indicted on a seven-count indictment for filing false tax returns and structuring cash deposits, in what the DOJ described as the "first criminal tax evasion prosecution centered solely on cryptocurrency." Ahlgren was an early Bitcoin investor who sold approximately 640 bitcoin (approximately $3.7 million) in October 2017 and used the proceeds to purchase a home in Park City, Utah, while falsely reporting his cryptocurrency gains on tax returns.

Ahlgren pleaded guilty to one count of willfully making and subscribing a false tax return under 26 U.S.C. Section 7206(1). On December 12, 2024, he was sentenced to 24 months in prison, one year of supervised release, and $1,095,031 in restitution. U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_Texas Man Charged for Filing Tax Returns That Falsely Reported His Cryptocurrency Gains_](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/texas-man-charged-filing-tax-returns-falsely-reported-his-cryptocurrency-gains).

The Ahlgren prosecution signaled the DOJ's willingness to bring standalone criminal tax cases based on cryptocurrency gains, as distinct from broader fraud or money laundering charges that may incidentally involve tax issues. The case also demonstrated the government's ability to trace cryptocurrency transactions through blockchain analysis to reconstruct a taxpayer's trading history and identify unreported gains. Practitioners should note that the IRS has significantly expanded its cryptocurrency reporting requirements, and the combination of enhanced information reporting by exchanges (under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act's expanded broker reporting provisions) and criminal prosecution capability creates meaningful compliance incentives. _See_ [IRS](https://www.thecod3x.com/irs/) for additional discussion of cryptocurrency tax enforcement.

## Asset Forfeiture and Seizure <a href="#asset-forfeiture-and-seizure" id="asset-forfeiture-and-seizure"></a>

### Major Seizures <a href="#major-seizures" id="major-seizures"></a>

The DOJ has executed cryptocurrency seizures of unprecedented scale. The largest seizures include:

| Rank | Case | Approximate Value | Date |
|------|------|-------------------|------|
| 1 | Chen Zhi / Pig Butchering (Cambodia) | ~$15 billion | October 2025 |
| 2 | Silk Road / 69,370 BTC ("Individual X") | ~$6.5 billion (2024 values) | November 2020 |
| 3 | Bitfinex Hack / Lichtenstein & Morgan | ~$3.6 billion | February 2022 |
| 4 | Silk Road / James Zhong | ~$3.36 billion (50,676 BTC) | November 2021 |
| 5 | Binance Settlement | $4.3 billion (penalty) | November 2023 |

The Bitfinex hack seizure merits additional discussion. _United States v. Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan_ (D.D.C.) involved the 2016 hack of the Bitfinex cryptocurrency exchange, in which Lichtenstein fraudulently authorized more than 2,000 transactions to steal 119,754 bitcoin. The DOJ seized $3.6 billion in cryptocurrency in February 2022 — the largest seizure in DOJ history at the time. Both defendants pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering on August 3, 2023. Lichtenstein was sentenced on November 14, 2024 to 60 months in prison; Morgan was sentenced on November 18, 2024 to 18 months. U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_Bitfinex Hacker Sentenced for Money Laundering Conspiracy Involving Billions in Stolen Cryptocurrency_](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/bitfinex-hacker-sentenced-money-laundering-conspiracy-involving-billions-stolen) (2024.11). Approximately $10 billion in stolen funds was ultimately recovered.

The forfeiture legal framework applied to cryptocurrency relies primarily on three statutes: 18 U.S.C. Section 981 (civil forfeiture), 18 U.S.C. Section 982 (criminal forfeiture), and 21 U.S.C. Section 853 (drug-related forfeiture). Civil forfeiture is used in cases where criminal prosecution is not possible — for instance, involving fugitives or foreign actors — through _in rem_ actions against the cryptocurrency itself. Criminal forfeiture is imposed as part of sentencing following conviction. The U.S. Marshals Service handles custody and liquidation of forfeited cryptocurrency, typically through auction or direct sale.

Cryptocurrency presents unique challenges for the forfeiture framework. The volatility of digital asset prices means that the value of forfeited holdings can change dramatically between the date of seizure and the date of liquidation or distribution. The DOJ and U.S. Marshals Service have adopted various approaches to managing this volatility risk, including prompt liquidation (to avoid further price fluctuation) and, following Executive Order 14233, indefinite holding in the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Additionally, the traceability of cryptocurrency on public blockchains — while advantageous for investigation — creates transparency around government holdings that does not exist for traditional forfeited assets, enabling public monitoring of government wallet addresses.

### Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Forfeited Crypto <a href="#strategic-bitcoin-reserve" id="strategic-bitcoin-reserve"></a>

On March 6, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14233, establishing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile. _See_ [Executive Actions](https://www.thecod3x.com/exec/). The Reserve is capitalized with bitcoin forfeited in criminal and civil proceedings and directs that bitcoin held in the Reserve "shall not be sold." As of March 2025, the U.S. government was estimated to hold over 207,000 BTC (approximately $17 billion). The Digital Asset Stockpile separately holds other cryptocurrencies including ETH, XRP, SOL, and ADA. White House, [_Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Establishes the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile_](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/03/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-establishes-the-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-and-u-s-digital-asset-stockpile/) (2025.03.06).

The intersection of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve with DOJ forfeiture operations raises novel legal questions. The Silk Road bitcoin illustrates this tension: on December 30, 2024, Chief U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg denied a motion by Battle Born Investments to block forfeiture of approximately 69,370 bitcoin (approximately $6.5 billion), clearing the DOJ to liquidate the holdings. In January 2025, court approval was finalized for the sale. However, Executive Order 14233, signed on March 6, 2025, directed that forfeited bitcoin "shall not be sold," creating uncertainty about whether any Silk Road bitcoin sales completed after that date complied with the executive order.

In November 2025, the DOJ apparently sold 57 bitcoin forfeited from the Samourai Wallet developers through Coinbase Prime, raising additional questions about compliance with the executive order's mandate.

### Victim Compensation <a href="#victim-compensation" id="victim-compensation"></a>

The DOJ's victim compensation program, administered by MLARS, has returned more than $12 billion in forfeited assets to victims since 2000 through remission petitions and restoration proceedings. The legal framework is set forth in 28 C.F.R. Section 9.8(c), which governs the priority of forfeited funds.

Notable victim compensation proceedings in the crypto space include: the FTX case, where the court ordered $12.7 billion in monetary relief ($8.7 billion in restitution, $4 billion in disgorgement), with over $1.2 billion of forfeiture proceeds potentially distributed through bankruptcy proceedings; the BitConnect case, where $56 million in seized cryptocurrency was sold as a first step toward compensating victims; and the Bitfinex hack case, where the DOJ recovered approximately $10 billion in stolen funds for potential return to the exchange and its account holders.

The tension between victim compensation and the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve mandate creates novel legal questions. Where forfeited bitcoin is subject to restitution orders, the obligation to compensate victims may conflict with the executive order's directive that forfeited bitcoin "shall not be sold." Courts have not yet resolved this tension, though the executive order's text contemplates that the Reserve may be funded with bitcoin "that is not needed to satisfy any existing obligation."

## International Cooperation <a href="#international-cooperation" id="international-cooperation"></a>

The inherently borderless nature of cryptocurrency transactions makes international cooperation essential to DOJ crypto enforcement. Cryptocurrency exchanges, mixers, and other services frequently operate across multiple jurisdictions, with operators, servers, and users located in different countries. The DOJ has developed a multi-faceted approach to international cooperation that encompasses extraditions, joint law enforcement operations, and formal mutual legal assistance.

### Extraditions <a href="#extraditions" id="extraditions"></a>

The DOJ has secured the extradition of numerous crypto defendants from foreign jurisdictions, reflecting the inherently cross-border nature of cryptocurrency crime:

| Defendant | From | To | Date | Case |
|-----------|------|----|------|------|
| Sam Bankman-Fried | Bahamas | U.S. | December 2022 | FTX fraud |
| Yaroslav Vasinskyi | Poland | U.S. | March 2022 | REvil ransomware |
| Alexander Vinnik | Greece (via France) | U.S. | August 2022 | BTC-e money laundering |
| Do Kwon | Montenegro | U.S. | December 31, 2024 | Terraform fraud |
| Aleksej Besciokov | India | U.S. | March 2025 | Garantex |
| Oleksii Lytvynenko | Ireland | U.S. | October 2025 | Conti ransomware |

Alexander Vinnik's case followed a particularly complex path: arrested in Greece in 2017, Vinnik was first extradited to France (where he was sentenced to five years), then returned to Greece, then extradited to the United States on August 4, 2022. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering in May 2024 for operating BTC-e, which processed over $9 billion in cryptocurrency for more than one million users from 2011 to 2017. On February 12, 2025, Vinnik was released as part of a U.S.-Russia prisoner exchange in which he was swapped for American teacher Marc Fogel.

### Joint Operations <a href="#joint-operations" id="joint-operations"></a>

The DOJ has conducted numerous joint international operations in the crypto space:

* **Hydra Market (April 2022):** U.S. and German law enforcement jointly seized servers and $25 million in bitcoin.
* **Hive Ransomware (January 2023):** Joint operation with Germany (BKA) and the Netherlands.
* **Bitzlato (January 2023):** Coordinated multinational takedown.
* **ALPHV/BlackCat (December 2023):** FBI, Europol, and authorities from eight nations.
* **LockBit (February 2024):** "Operation Cronos" with the UK NCA, FBI, Europol, and multiple European agencies; seizure of 34 servers across multiple countries.
* **Garantex (March 2025):** U.S. Secret Service with German and Finnish law enforcement.

### MLAT Cooperation <a href="#mlat-cooperation" id="mlat-cooperation"></a>

The DOJ routinely employs Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) cooperation in cryptocurrency cases, particularly for server seizures located in foreign jurisdictions (e.g., Iceland for Samourai Wallet, Germany for Hydra Market), cryptocurrency exchange data requests, arrest and extradition proceedings, and asset freezing and forfeiture coordination. The cross-border nature of cryptocurrency transactions makes international cooperation an essential component of virtually every major DOJ crypto prosecution.

The Vinnik case illustrates both the potential and limitations of international cooperation. Despite being arrested in Greece in 2017, Vinnik was not extradited to the United States until August 2022, after first being sent to France for prosecution there. Following his guilty plea in the United States in May 2024, Vinnik was released in February 2025 as part of a U.S.-Russia prisoner exchange — demonstrating how geopolitical considerations can intersect with criminal enforcement in the cryptocurrency space.

Practitioners should also be aware that the DOJ's international cooperation capabilities extend to informal channels, including law enforcement-to-law enforcement coordination, intelligence sharing through the Five Eyes alliance, and engagement with international bodies such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which has promulgated global standards for virtual asset service provider regulation. The FATF's "Travel Rule," requiring VASPs to share originator and beneficiary information for cross-border transfers, has become an important tool for DOJ investigations by enabling investigators to obtain identifying information from compliant foreign exchanges.

## Cooperation with Civil Regulators <a href="#cooperation-with-civil-regulators" id="cooperation-with-civil-regulators"></a>

A defining feature of DOJ crypto enforcement has been the pattern of parallel criminal and civil proceedings, in which DOJ criminal prosecution is accompanied by civil enforcement actions brought by one or more regulatory agencies. Practitioners representing targets or defendants in one proceeding should assume the existence of parallel proceedings with other agencies. This parallel structure creates important strategic considerations for defense counsel, as statements made, or cooperation provided, in one proceeding may have implications in parallel proceedings. The Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination applies in the criminal context but not in civil regulatory proceedings, creating potential tension when both proceedings are active simultaneously.

The DOJ and civil regulators coordinate through information-sharing agreements, joint task forces, and informal communication channels. In several high-profile cases, such as Binance and FTX, the DOJ and multiple civil regulators have announced enforcement actions on the same day, reflecting a coordinated multi-agency approach.

**SEC Parallel Actions:** The [SEC](https://www.thecod3x.com/sec/) has brought civil charges alongside DOJ criminal prosecutions in numerous cases, including FTX (SEC civil charges alongside DOJ prosecution), Terraform Labs (SEC $4.5 billion civil judgment), Celsius (SEC civil charges), BitConnect (SEC civil enforcement), Coinbase insider trading (SEC civil action parallel to DOJ prosecution of Ishan Wahi), Hydrogen Technology (SEC charges alongside DOJ criminal case), and Forsage (SEC charged 11 individuals).

**CFTC Parallel Actions:** The [CFTC](https://www.thecod3x.com/cftc/) has brought parallel civil actions in the Binance case (civil enforcement alongside DOJ), the BitMEX case ($30 million penalty), the FTX case ($12.7 billion judgment), and the KuCoin case.

**FinCEN Parallel Actions:** [FinCEN](https://www.thecod3x.com/fincen/) has assessed parallel civil money penalties in the Binance case ($3.4 billion with a five-year monitorship) and the Helix case ($60 million penalty against Harmon).

**OFAC/Treasury Coordination:** [OFAC](https://www.thecod3x.com/ofac/) has coordinated enforcement actions with DOJ in the Binance case ($968 million penalty), the Tornado Cash case (OFAC designation of smart contracts, later overturned by the Fifth Circuit), the Hydra Market case (OFAC designated Hydra and Garantex), and the Garantex case (OFAC re-designation alongside DOJ prosecution).

The Blanche Memo's directive to defer regulatory framework questions to civil regulators may alter this dynamic going forward, as DOJ prosecutors are directed to focus on criminal conduct rather than regulatory compliance questions.

## Crypto Pardons <a href="#crypto-pardons" id="crypto-pardons"></a>

The Trump administration granted executive clemency to several individuals convicted in cryptocurrency cases, marking the first time that crypto-related convictions were the subject of presidential pardons.

### Ross Ulbricht (January 21, 2025) <a href="#ulbricht-pardon" id="ulbricht-pardon"></a>

On January 21, 2025 — the first full day of the Trump presidency — President Trump granted a full and unconditional pardon to Ross Ulbricht, who had been serving a life sentence without parole for his role as creator and operator of the Silk Road darknet marketplace. U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_Ulbricht Pardon Warrant_](https://www.justice.gov/pardon/media/1386096/dl) (2025.01.21). The pardon fulfilled a campaign pledge Trump had made to Libertarian supporters. Ulbricht had served approximately ten years of his sentence at the time of the pardon.

The pardon was notable for its breadth — extending to all offenses of conviction — and for the severity of the underlying sentence. At the time of sentencing, Judge Forrest had stated that Silk Road facilitated the sale of drugs that contributed to at least six overdose deaths. Civil liberties advocates and cryptocurrency industry groups had long argued that the life sentence was disproportionate, while law enforcement officials maintained that the sentence reflected the scope of criminal activity enabled by the platform.

### BitMEX Co-Founders (March 28, 2025) <a href="#bitmex-pardons" id="bitmex-pardons"></a>

On March 28, 2025, President Trump granted full pardons to Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, and Samuel Reed, the co-founders of the BitMEX cryptocurrency derivatives exchange. All three had pleaded guilty to Bank Secrecy Act violations in 2022 for operating BitMEX without adequate anti-money laundering controls while allowing U.S. customers to trade. Hayes had been sentenced to probation and home detention; Delo to probation and a $10 million fine.

The pardons were consistent with the administration's broader policy view, articulated in the Blanche Memo, that regulatory violations in the crypto space should not be pursued as criminal matters absent clear evidence of willful knowledge.

### Changpeng Zhao (October 23, 2025) <a href="#cz-pardon" id="cz-pardon"></a>

On October 23, 2025, President Trump granted a full pardon to Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance, who had pleaded guilty to willfully violating the BSA and served four months in prison. The White House characterized the prosecution as part of the Biden administration's "war on cryptocurrency."

The Zhao pardon generated significant controversy. Congressional Democrats, led by Senator Elizabeth Warren, wrote to Attorney General Bondi and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent raising concerns about the pardon's implications for the integrity of the $4.3 billion Binance plea agreement and the five-year compliance monitorship. _See_ Senate Banking Committee, [_Letter to DOJ and Treasury Regarding Binance Pardon_](https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_to_doj_treasury_re_binance_pardon.pdf). Critics also noted reports of financial connections between the Trump family and Binance-related entities, while supporters argued the pardon corrected prosecutorial overreach in treating regulatory compliance failures as criminal conduct.

Practitioners should note that a presidential pardon eliminates the criminal conviction but does not, as a matter of law, void the corporate plea agreement, monitorship, or civil penalties imposed on Binance itself. The Binance corporate compliance obligations, including the five-year monitorship imposed as part of the plea agreement and the separate [FinCEN](https://www.thecod3x.com/fincen/) and [OFAC](https://www.thecod3x.com/ofac/) settlements, remain legally distinct from Zhao's personal criminal case. Whether the administration will seek to modify these corporate obligations through separate channels remains an open question as of February 2026.

Taken together, the Ulbricht, BitMEX, and Zhao pardons reflect a broader policy view that the prior administration's criminal enforcement approach to cryptocurrency regulation was disproportionate. However, the pardons have no direct legal effect on the underlying statutes or enforcement authorities available to future administrations.
