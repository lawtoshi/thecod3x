# 1.40 - Executive Actions

## Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

The executive branch has emerged as the single most consequential force in shaping federal cryptocurrency and digital asset policy. Through executive orders, agency directives, personnel appointments, and interagency coordination, two successive administrations have charted dramatically divergent courses for the digital asset industry in the United States.

On March 9, 2022, President Biden signed Executive Order 14067, titled _Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets_, the first-ever comprehensive executive order on digital assets. EO 14067 marshaled a whole-of-government approach across more than two dozen federal agencies, resulting in nine reports to the President, a "Comprehensive Framework" released in September 2022, and an enforcement-oriented posture that defined the Biden administration's approach through early 2025. The executive order explored a U.S. central bank digital currency ("CBDC"), emphasized consumer protection and illicit finance risks, and called for Congressional action on stablecoin legislation that did not materialize during the Biden term.

On January 23, 2025, three days after taking office, President Trump signed Executive Order 14178, titled _Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology_, which revoked EO 14067 in its entirety and executed one of the most dramatic policy reversals in modern financial regulatory history. EO 14178 prohibited any federal action to establish or promote a CBDC, created the Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets chaired by newly appointed "AI & Crypto Czar" David Sacks, and directed agencies to identify and rescind regulations that impede digital asset development. The Trump administration followed with the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve on March 6, 2025, the signing of the GENIUS Act (the first federal stablecoin legislation) on July 18, 2025, and a series of pardons of convicted crypto-industry figures.

These two executive orders serve as bookends of a period in which presidential action fundamentally transformed the federal regulatory landscape for digital assets. This section examines the executive actions of both administrations, the personnel appointments that shaped agency-level implementation, and the policy continuities and reversals between the two approaches.

## President's Working Group on Financial Markets <a href="#presidents-working-group-on-financial-markets" id="presidents-working-group-on-financial-markets"></a>

### PWG Stablecoin Report (November 2021) <a href="#pwg-stablecoin-report" id="pwg-stablecoin-report"></a>

In November 2021, the President's Working Group on Financial Markets coordinated with the [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency](https://www.thecod3x.com/occ/) and the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation](https://www.thecod3x.com/fdic/) to release a report on the uses, risks, and opportunities for stablecoins. _See_ President's Working Group on Financial Markets, the FDIC, and the OCC, [_Report on Stablecoins_](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/StableCoinReport_Nov1_508.pdf) (2021.11). The report outlined the various use cases for stablecoins, documented their explosive growth, detailed perceived risks (to users, to the payments system, and to the greater financial system), and issued a call to action to Congress to enact a "consistent and comprehensive regulatory framework" for stablecoins.

The key aspects of that regulatory framework, as requested by the report, were:

* limiting stablecoin issuers (and those offering redemption and maintenance of reserve assets) to entities that are insured depository institutions, and making them subject to supervision at the depository and holding company levels;
* requiring custodial wallet providers for stablecoins to be subject to federal oversight, including restrictions on lending, compliance obligations for risk management, liquidity, and capital requirements;
* limits on custodial wallet providers' affiliation with commercial entities or on use of users' transaction data; and
* ensuring the federal supervisor of a stablecoin issuer has examination and enforcement authority to require issuers to meet risk-management standards, and the authority to implement standards to promote interoperability among stablecoins.

[_Id._](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/StableCoinReport_Nov1_508.pdf) at 16--17. The report also noted that other federal regulatory agencies may have a role to play in oversight of stablecoins, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the [Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.thecod3x.com/sec/), the [Commodity Futures Trading Commission](https://www.thecod3x.com/cftc/), [Office of Foreign Assets Control](https://www.thecod3x.com/ofac/), and [Financial Crimes Enforcement Network](https://www.thecod3x.com/fincen/). [_Id._](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/StableCoinReport_Nov1_508.pdf) at 15, 18, 20. The reference to FinCEN was of particular note, because FinCEN's regulations require registering with it as a money services business (MSB), establishing an anti-money laundering program, reporting cash transactions of $10,000 or more, and filing suspicious activity reports (SARs). [_Id._](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/StableCoinReport_Nov1_508.pdf) at 20. Doing so may cause downstream compliance issues because, as the report noted, "\[c]urrent \[Bank Secrecy Act] regulations require the transfer of certain specific information well beyond what can be inferred from the blockchain resulting in non-compliance." [_Id._](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/StableCoinReport_Nov1_508.pdf)

Congress did not enact the PWG's recommended legislation during the Biden administration. The call for stablecoin issuers to be insured depository institutions was never implemented legislatively during that period. Banking regulators did issue interagency guidance discouraging bank involvement with crypto in January and February 2023. Stablecoin legislation ultimately arrived on July 18, 2025, when President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law -- but under a materially different framework than the PWG had recommended, establishing a dual federal-state chartering system rather than requiring issuers to be insured depository institutions. _See_ [Treasury](https://www.thecod3x.com/treasury/) for further discussion of the GENIUS Act's regulatory framework.

## Biden Administration (2021-2025) <a href="#biden-administration" id="biden-administration"></a>

### Executive Order 14067 (March 9, 2022) <a href="#executive-order-14067" id="executive-order-14067"></a>

After significant anticipation from the industry, on March 9, 2022, President Biden signed Executive Order 14067, titled [_Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets_](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/03/14/2022-05471/ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets), 87 Fed. Reg. 14143 (the "EO"). This was President Biden's 83rd executive order and the first-ever comprehensive executive order on digital assets. _See_ White House, [_FACT SHEET: President Biden to Sign Executive Order on Ensuring Responsible Innovation in Digital Assets_](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/09/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-sign-executive-order-on-ensuring-responsible-innovation-in-digital-assets/) (2022.03.09). The EO required the coordination (led by the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy) of huge swaths of both executive branch and independent federal administrative agencies. That coordination was to occur through meetings of 25 agency heads, including the Secretaries of State, [Treasury](https://www.thecod3x.com/treasury/), Defense, Commerce, Labor, Energy, Homeland Security, National Intelligence, [the Federal Reserve](https://www.thecod3x.com/thefed/), Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Trade Commission, [Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.thecod3x.com/sec/), [Commodity Futures Trading Commission](https://www.thecod3x.com/cftc/), and the [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency](https://www.thecod3x.com/occ/). _Id._ at section 3.

EO 14067 was revoked in its entirety by Executive Order 14178 on January 23, 2025.

#### Policy Objectives <a href="#eo-14067-policy-objectives" id="eo-14067-policy-objectives"></a>

The agency heads named in EO 14067 were tasked with creating a unified federal government digital assets framework to advance six policy objectives for the United States:

1. Protecting consumers, investors, and businesses.
2. Protecting United States and global financial stability and mitigating systemic risk.
3. Mitigating illicit finance and national security risks posed by misuse of digital assets.
4. Reinforcing U.S. leadership in the global financial system and in technological and economic competitiveness, including through the responsible development of payment innovations and digital assets.
5. Promoting access to safe and affordable financial services.
6. Supporting technological advances that promote responsible development and use of digital assets.

_Id._ at section 2. The EO set forth specific measures, mostly in the form of intensive research reports to the President largely due within six months, to advance each of those objectives.

#### CBDC Provisions <a href="#eo-14067-cbdc-provisions" id="eo-14067-cbdc-provisions"></a>

Because "\[s]overeign money is at the core of a well-functioning financial system, macroeconomic stabilization policies, and economic growth," the EO stated that the Biden administration "place\[d] the highest urgency on research and development efforts into the potential design and deployment options of a United States CBDC." _Id._ at section 4. It stated that a CBDC must be consistent with "democratic values, including privacy protections," while also ensuring "the global financial system has appropriate transparency, connectivity, and platform and architecture interoperability or transferability." _Id._ at section 4(a)(ii).

The EO suggested that an effective CBDC could "support the continued centrality of the United States within the international financial system, and help to protect the unique role that the dollar plays in global finance." _Id._ at section 4(a)(iii).

To explore the strengths and potential pitfalls of a CBDC, the EO required reports on the following timelines:

* Within 180 days (by September 5, 2022):
  * A report on "the future of money and payment systems" covering the implications of a CBDC on economic growth and stability, financial inclusion, private-sector digital assets, the future of sovereign money and democracy, and national security and financial crime;
  * A report on "whether legislative changes would be necessary to issue a United States CBDC."
* Within 210 days (by October 5, 2022):
  * A legislative proposal based on considerations explored in the above reports, along with any additional work done by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve (likely a reference to continued work on [Project Hamilton](http://thecod3x.com/thefed/)).

_Id._ at section 4(b), (d).

The OSTP submitted two reports addressing CBDC -- one on technical evaluation and one on policy objectives -- both released on September 16, 2022. The Treasury Department submitted its report on the future of money and payments on the same date. No legislative proposal for CBDC issuance was ultimately submitted to Congress. All federal CBDC research and development was terminated by EO 14178 on January 23, 2025.

#### Consumer and Investor Protection Provisions <a href="#eo-14067-consumer-protection" id="eo-14067-consumer-protection"></a>

To assess risks associated with digital asset use such as fraud, theft, and data breaches, the EO called for a number of reports from federal agencies within 180 days (by September 5, 2022):

* A report on "the implications of developments and adoption of digital assets and changes in financial market and payment system infrastructures for United States consumers, investors, businesses, and for equitable economic growth," addressing "the conditions that would drive mass adoption of different types of digital assets" and concomitant risks of adoption, including policy and legislative recommendations.
* A report providing "a technical evaluation of the technological infrastructure, capacity, and expertise that would be necessary at relevant agencies to facilitate and support the introduction of a CBDC system should one be proposed," evaluating technical risks including future developments such as quantum computing and how it could affect the work of the U.S. government and the provision of social-safety-net programs.
* A report "on the role of law enforcement agencies in detecting, investigating, and prosecuting criminal activity related to digital assets," including recommended regulatory or legislative action.
* A report "on the connections between distributed ledger technology and short-, medium, and long-term economic and energy transitions; the potential for these technologies to impede or advance efforts to tackle climate change at home and abroad; and the impacts these technologies have on the environment," specifically required to address the effect of different consensus mechanisms on energy usage.

_Id._ at section 5(b)(i)--(iii), (vii)--(viii).

The EO also required a report from the Secretary of the Treasury and the [Financial Stability Oversight Council](https://www.thecod3x.com/fsoc/) (FSOC), by October 5, 2022, "outlining the specific financial stability risks and regulatory gaps posed by various types of digital assets and providing recommendations to address such risks." _Id._ at section 6(b). All reports were submitted on time; the nine primary reports were completed by October 2022.

#### Illicit Finance and National Security Provisions <a href="#eo-14067-illicit-finance" id="eo-14067-illicit-finance"></a>

The EO stated that increased usage of digital assets "heightens risks of crimes such as money laundering, terrorist and proliferation financing, fraud and theft schemes, and corruption." To mitigate those risks, the EO called for several actions:

* Supplemental annexes to the National Strategy for Combating Terrorist and Other Illicit Financing, to be submitted to the President within 90 days of the National Strategy's submission to Congress by the Treasury Department. The updated National Strategy was due to Congress on January 31, 2022, and the Treasury Department submitted the supplemental annexes in 2022. _See_ Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, section 262, [131 Stat. 934](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3364/text) (2017.08.02).

Thirty days after those supplemental annexes were provided to the President, the EO required the Secretary of the Treasury to "develop a coordinated action plan based on the Strategy's conclusions for mitigating the digital-asset-related illicit finance and national security risks addressed in the updated strategy." _Id._ at section 7(b), (c). The Treasury Department published its Action Plan to Address Illicit Financing Risks of Digital Assets on September 16, 2022.

#### International Coordination Provisions <a href="#eo-14067-international-coordination" id="eo-14067-international-coordination"></a>

The EO stressed the importance of international cooperation and highlighted actions the U.S. had taken on the world stage to promote an even regulatory playing field, such as leading the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to develop and adopt "the first international standards on digital assets," establishing the G7 Digital Payments Experts Group, and working with the international Financial Stability Board and the G20 roadmap. _Id._ at section 8(a)(ii)--(v); G7, [_G7 Public Policy Principles for Retail Central Bank Digital Currencies_](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/g7-public-policy-principles-for-retail-central-bank-digital-currencies-and-g7-finance-ministers-and-central-bank-governors-statement-on-central-bank) (2021.10.14); FATF, [_Updated Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach to Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers_](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfrecommendations/documents/guidance-rba-virtual-assets-2021.html) (2021.10.28).

The EO required the following international coordination actions:

* By July 7, 2022, the Secretary of the Treasury was to establish a framework for interagency international engagement with foreign counterparts. The Treasury Department published this framework on July 7, 2022. _See_ Department of the Treasury, [_Framework for International Engagement on Digital Assets_](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0854) (2022.07.07). This framework was revoked by EO 14178 on January 23, 2025.
* By July 7, 2023, the Secretary of the Treasury was to submit a report on priority actions taken under the framework.
* By September 5, 2022, the Secretary of Commerce was to establish a framework for enhancing U.S. economic competitiveness in digital asset technologies.
* By June 7, 2022, the Attorney General was to submit a report on how to strengthen international law enforcement cooperation for detecting, investigating, and prosecuting criminal activity related to digital assets.

_Id._ at section 8(b)(i)--(iv).

### Agency Reports Under EO 14067 <a href="#agency-reports-eo-14067" id="agency-reports-eo-14067"></a>

Nine reports were submitted to the President in response to Executive Order 14067. The White House released its Comprehensive Framework on September 16, 2022, announcing the completion of all nine reports. Those reports are:

**Report 1:** White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), [_Climate and Energy Implications of Crypto-Assets in the United States_](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/09-2022-Crypto-Assets-and-Climate-Report.pdf) (2022.09.08). Pursuant to EO section 5(b)(viii). Key findings: global electricity usage for crypto-assets was estimated at 120--240 billion kWh per year; the U.S. hosted approximately one-third of global crypto-asset operations, consuming 0.9% to 1.7% of total U.S. electricity usage; recommended that the Energy Information Administration collect data from miners and utilities.

**Report 2:** White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), [_Technical Evaluation for a U.S. Central Bank Digital Currency System_](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/09/16/technical-possibilities-for-a-u-s-central-bank-digital-currency/) (2022.09.16). Pursuant to EO section 4. Analyzed 18 CBDC design choices across six categories (participants, governance, security, transactions, data, and adjustments); did not make a recommendation on whether the U.S. should pursue a CBDC.

**Report 3:** White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), [_Policy Objectives for a U.S. CBDC System_](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/09-2022-Policy-Objectives-US-CBDC-System.pdf) (2022.09.16). Pursuant to EO section 4. Companion to the technical evaluation; outlined policy objectives that any potential CBDC system should meet, including expanding equitable access and preserving the role of physical cash.

**Report 4:** Department of Justice, [_The Role of Law Enforcement in Detecting, Investigating, and Prosecuting Criminal Activity Related to Digital Assets_](https://www.justice.gov/ag/page/file/1535236/download) (2022.09.16). Pursuant to EO section 5(b)(iii). Prepared by the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET); announced the Digital Asset Coordinator (DAC) Network of over 150 federal prosecutors; recommended expanding the Bank Secrecy Act to cover virtual asset service providers and NFTs.

**Report 5:** Department of the Treasury, [_The Future of Money and Payments_](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Future-of-Money-and-Payments.pdf) (2022.09.16). Pursuant to EO section 4. Four recommendations: advance work on a possible CBDC; encourage use of instant payment systems; establish a federal framework for payments regulation; prioritize improvements to cross-border payments.

**Report 6:** Department of the Treasury, [_Crypto-Assets: Implications for Consumers, Investors, and Businesses_](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/CryptoAsset_EO5.pdf) (2022.09.16). Pursuant to EO section 5. Identified substantial risks to consumers and investors from crypto-assets, addressing market integrity, consumer protection, and financial stability.

**Report 7:** Department of the Treasury, [_Action Plan to Address Illicit Financing Risks of Digital Assets_](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Digital-Asset-Action-Plan.pdf) (2022.09.16). Pursuant to EO section 7. Identified digital assets used in money laundering, ransomware crimes, sanctions evasion, and terrorist financing; priority actions included monitoring emerging risks, strengthening AML supervision, and pursuing cybercriminals.

**Report 8:** Department of Commerce, [_Responsible Advancement of U.S. Competitiveness in Digital Assets_](https://www.commerce.gov/sites/default/files/2022-09/Digital-Asset-Competitiveness-Report.pdf) (2022.09.16). Pursuant to EO section 8. Established four pillars: effective regulatory approaches; international engagement and trade promotion; meaningful public-private engagement; sustained U.S. leadership in technological R&D.

**Report 9:** Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), [_Report on Digital Asset Financial Stability Risks and Regulation_](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/FSOC-Digital-Assets-Report-2022.pdf) (2022.10.03). Pursuant to EO section 6. Concluded crypto-asset activities could pose risks to U.S. financial stability; identified three principal regulatory gaps: limited federal oversight of crypto spot markets for non-securities, opportunities for regulatory arbitrage, and vertical integration of crypto-asset services; recommended legislation providing rulemaking authority over crypto spot markets.

### Comprehensive Framework (September 2022) <a href="#comprehensive-framework" id="comprehensive-framework"></a>

On September 16, 2022, the White House released a fact sheet describing a framework it created regarding the federal government's approach to digital assets. White House, [_FACT SHEET: White House Releases First-Ever Comprehensive Framework for Responsible Development of Digital Assets_](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/16/fact-sheet-white-house-releases-first-ever-comprehensive-framework-for-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/) (2022.09.16). That framework was the result of six months' of work from many federal agencies. In broad strokes, the framework continued the key objectives identified by Executive Order 14067: "consumer and investor protection; promoting financial stability; countering illicit finance; U.S. leadership in the global financial system and economic competitiveness; financial inclusion; and responsible innovation." _Id._ Based on those objectives, it called for, _inter alia_:

* More aggressive enforcement against bad actors by the [SEC](https://www.thecod3x.com/sec/), [CFTC](https://www.thecod3x.com/cftc/), and [DOJ](https://www.thecod3x.com/doj/);
* Enhanced consumer protection by the CFPB and the FTC, and consumer education by the Financial Literacy and Education Commission (FLEC);
* Issuance of rules and guidance by various agencies, encouraged to issue in coordination with each other;
* Continued work on "instant payment systems," including FedNow, while the President considers "agency recommendations to create a federal framework to regulate nonbank payment providers";
* Continued analysis and tracking of digital assets' environmental impacts;
* Coordination among agencies, industry, academics, and civilians, led by the Department of Commerce;
* Continued U.S. involvement and leadership on digital assets in international bodies such as the G7, G20, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Financial Stability Board (FSB), and Financial Action Task Force (FATF);
* Consideration of whether to recommend to Congress amending the BSA, anti-tip-off statutes, and money transmitter laws to apply explicitly to digital asset service providers; and
* Extensive additional research and development of a United States CBDC.

The framework served as a policy declaration rather than a binding regulatory mandate. Many of its recommendations required Congressional action that did not materialize during the Biden administration. Enforcement agencies -- primarily the [SEC](https://www.thecod3x.com/sec/) under Chair Gary Gensler -- interpreted the framework as supporting aggressive enforcement actions against crypto firms. _See_ [SEC](https://www.thecod3x.com/sec/) for further discussion of enforcement trends.

### NEC Crypto Risk Roadmap (January 2023) <a href="#nec-crypto-risk-roadmap" id="nec-crypto-risk-roadmap"></a>

On January 27, 2023, the National Economic Council published "The Administration's Roadmap to Mitigate Cryptocurrencies' Risks." National Economic Council, [_The Administration's Roadmap to Mitigate Cryptocurrencies' Risks_](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/nec/briefing-room/2023/01/27/the-administrations-roadmap-to-mitigate-cryptocurrencies-risks/) (2023.01.27). The roadmap was co-authored by NEC Director Brian Deese, OSTP Director Arati Prabhakar, Council of Economic Advisers Chair Cecilia Rouse, and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan.

Published in the wake of the FTX collapse of November 2022 and the broader crypto market downturn, the roadmap articulated the administration's post-framework enforcement posture. Key elements included:

* A call on regulators to "ramp up enforcement where appropriate and issue new guidance where needed";
* Highlighting the banking agencies' joint guidance on "separating risky digital assets from the banking system" (the January 3, 2023 Joint Statement on Crypto-Asset Risks);
* A call on Congress to "step up its efforts" on crypto legislation; and
* Framing of crypto primarily through the lens of consumer harm and risk mitigation.

The roadmap marked a rhetorical shift from the more balanced tone of EO 14067 toward a more enforcement-focused and risk-averse posture. It was published approximately two months after the FTX collapse and reflected the administration's view that the collapse confirmed the need for its cautious approach.

### SAB 121 and Congressional Override Attempt <a href="#sab-121" id="sab-121"></a>

#### SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (March 31, 2022) <a href="#sab-121-issuance" id="sab-121-issuance"></a>

On March 31, 2022, the [SEC](https://www.thecod3x.com/sec/) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 ("SAB 121"), which required entities that hold custody of crypto-assets on behalf of platform users to record a liability and corresponding asset on their balance sheets at fair value. _See_ SEC, [_Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121_](https://www.sec.gov/rules-regulations/staff-guidance/staff-accounting-bulletins/staff-accounting-bulletin-121) (2022.03.31). The guidance cited "unique technological, legal, and regulatory risks" associated with safeguarding crypto-assets. The practical effect was to make it extremely costly for banks to offer crypto custody services, as the on-balance-sheet requirement triggered additional capital requirements. SAB 121 was widely criticized for effectively blocking traditional banks and financial institutions from entering the crypto custody business.

#### Congressional Resolution to Overturn (H.J.Res. 109) <a href="#sab-121-hjres-109" id="sab-121-hjres-109"></a>

In May 2024, Congress used the Congressional Review Act to attempt to nullify SAB 121. The House of Representatives voted 228--182 in favor of repeal on May 8, 2024, and the Senate voted 60--38 in favor on May 16, 2024. _See_ [H.J.Res. 109](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-joint-resolution/109), 118th Congress. The bipartisan support was notable, with significant Democratic votes in both chambers.

#### Biden Veto (May 31, 2024) <a href="#sab-121-biden-veto" id="sab-121-biden-veto"></a>

On May 31, 2024, President Biden vetoed H.J.Res. 109, stating that SAB 121 was "necessary" for crypto innovation and that overturning it would "inappropriately constrain the SEC's ability to set appropriate guardrails." The House failed to override the veto on July 11, 2024. The veto was one of the most significant concrete executive actions against the crypto industry during the Biden administration, and it highlighted the disconnect between bipartisan Congressional support for modifying crypto-related accounting rules and the administration's enforcement-oriented approach.

SAB 121 was subsequently rescinded by SAB 122 on January 23, 2025, issued by the [SEC](https://www.thecod3x.com/sec/) under Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda on the same day as EO 14178.

### Additional Biden-Era Actions <a href="#additional-biden-era-actions" id="additional-biden-era-actions"></a>

#### Banking Regulator Joint Statements (2023) <a href="#banking-regulator-joint-statements" id="banking-regulator-joint-statements"></a>

On January 3, 2023, the [OCC](https://www.thecod3x.com/occ/), [Federal Reserve](https://www.thecod3x.com/thefed/), and [FDIC](https://www.thecod3x.com/fdic/) issued a "Joint Statement on Crypto-Asset Risks to Banking Organizations," highlighting risks including fraud, legal uncertainties, contagion risk, and volatility, and effectively signaling to banks that crypto engagement carried supervisory risk. On February 23, 2023, the same agencies issued a "Joint Statement on Liquidity Risks to Banking Organizations Resulting from Crypto-Asset Market Vulnerabilities," warning banks about liquidity risks from concentrated crypto deposits following the collapse of crypto-friendly banks such as Silvergate. Both statements were withdrawn in March and April 2025 under the Trump administration.

#### OCC Interpretive Letter 1179 (November 18, 2021) <a href="#occ-il-1179" id="occ-il-1179"></a>

The [OCC](https://www.thecod3x.com/occ/) issued Interpretive Letter 1179, requiring national banks and federal savings associations to obtain a letter of non-objection from their supervisory office before engaging in crypto-related activities (custody, stablecoin reserves, DLT payments). This reversed the permissive posture of Trump-era OCC Interpretive Letters 1170, 1172, and 1174, creating a de facto pre-approval regime that significantly slowed bank entry into crypto services. IL 1179 was rescinded by OCC Interpretive Letter 1183 on March 7, 2025.

#### Federal Reserve Supervisory Guidance <a href="#federal-reserve-supervisory-guidance" id="federal-reserve-supervisory-guidance"></a>

On August 16, 2022, [the Federal Reserve](https://www.thecod3x.com/thefed/) issued SR 22-6, requiring FRB-supervised banking organizations to provide advance notification before engaging in crypto-asset-related activities. In 2023, the Federal Reserve issued SR 23-8, requiring state member banks to obtain written supervisory non-objection before engaging in activities involving "dollar tokens" (stablecoins) to facilitate payments. Both SR 22-6 and SR 23-8 were rescinded on April 24, 2025. _See_ [the Fed](https://www.thecod3x.com/thefed/).

#### FDIC FIL-16-2022 (April 2022) <a href="#fdic-fil-16-2022" id="fdic-fil-16-2022"></a>

The [FDIC](https://www.thecod3x.com/fdic/) issued Financial Institution Letter 16-2022 in April 2022, requiring FDIC-supervised institutions to notify the FDIC before engaging in crypto-related activities, creating a framework parallel to OCC IL 1179 and Federal Reserve SR 22-6.

#### DAME Tax Proposal (2023-2024) <a href="#dame-tax-proposal" id="dame-tax-proposal"></a>

The Biden administration proposed the Digital Asset Mining Energy (DAME) excise tax in both its FY2024 budget (March 9, 2023) and FY2025 budget (March 11, 2024). The tax would have imposed a 30% excise tax on the cost of electricity used by crypto mining operations, phased in over three years, with projected revenue of up to $3.5 billion over 10 years. The administration cited the OSTP's September 2022 climate report, arguing crypto mining had "negative spillovers" on the environment and electricity grids. The DAME tax was dropped from the debt ceiling deal in May 2023 and never enacted. The Trump administration made no similar proposal and publicly opposed such measures.

#### Treasury Illicit Finance Risk Assessments (2023-2024) <a href="#treasury-risk-assessments" id="treasury-risk-assessments"></a>

Building on the EO 14067 agency reports, the Treasury Department produced two additional risk assessments during the Biden administration. On April 6, 2023, Treasury published the first-ever government illicit finance risk assessment of DeFi, finding that illicit actors including DPRK-linked cyber actors were using DeFi for money laundering. _See_ Department of the Treasury, [_Illicit Finance Risk Assessment of Decentralized Finance_](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/DeFi-Risk-Full-Review.pdf) (2023.04.06). On May 29, 2024, Treasury published the first-ever government risk assessment of NFTs, finding NFTs "highly susceptible to use in fraud and scams," though with little evidence of misuse by terrorists or proliferators. _See_ Department of the Treasury, [_Illicit Finance Risk Assessment of Non-Fungible Tokens_](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Illicit-Finance-Risk-Assessment-of-Non-Fungible-Tokens.pdf) (2024.05.29).

#### FY2025 Budget: Wash-Sale Rule Extension (March 2024) <a href="#wash-sale-rule" id="wash-sale-rule"></a>

The FY2025 budget proposed extending the wash-sale rule to digital assets, which would have prevented investors from claiming tax deductions on losses from selling and repurchasing the same crypto asset within a 30-day window. The proposal was never enacted into law. _See_ [IRS](https://www.thecod3x.com/irs/) for further discussion of digital asset taxation.

## Trump Administration (2025-present) <a href="#trump-administration" id="trump-administration"></a>

### Executive Order 14178 (January 23, 2025) <a href="#executive-order-14178" id="executive-order-14178"></a>

On January 23, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14178, titled [_Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology_](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/strengthening-american-leadership-in-digital-financial-technology/). _See also_ GovInfo, [_DCPD-202500169_](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/DCPD-202500169) (2025.01.23). EO 14178 represented the most dramatic policy reversal in U.S. digital asset regulation to date, shifting the federal posture from caution and enforcement to explicit support and promotion.

#### Revocation of EO 14067 <a href="#revocation-of-eo-14067" id="revocation-of-eo-14067"></a>

Section 2 of EO 14178 revoked Executive Order 14067 of March 9, 2022 in its entirety. It further directed the Secretary of the Treasury to "immediately revoke" the Department of the Treasury's Framework for International Engagement on Digital Assets (July 7, 2022).

#### CBDC Prohibition <a href="#cbdc-prohibition" id="cbdc-prohibition"></a>

Section 3 of EO 14178 prohibited agencies from "undertaking any action to establish, issue, or promote central bank digital currencies within the jurisdiction of the United States or abroad." It further required that "any ongoing plans or initiatives at any agency related to the creation of a CBDC within the United States shall be immediately terminated." This prohibition was unprecedented among major world economies at the time of its issuance.

#### Working Group on Digital Asset Markets <a href="#working-group-on-digital-asset-markets" id="working-group-on-digital-asset-markets"></a>

Section 6 of EO 14178 established the Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets within the National Economic Council, chaired by the Special Advisor for AI and Crypto (David Sacks). The Working Group was mandated to deliver a detailed report to the President within 180 days outlining a proposed federal regulatory framework covering market structure, oversight, consumer protection, and risk management. On national security issues, the Working Group was to consult with the National Security Council. The Working Group's report was delivered on July 30, 2025.

EO 14178 also stated a policy to "support the responsible growth and use of digital assets, blockchain technology and related technologies across all sectors of the economy," explicitly committing to protect the rights to develop and deploy software, participate in mining and validating, transact without unlawful censorship, and maintain self-custody of digital assets. _Id._ at section 1. Section 4 backed "the sovereignty of the United States dollar, including through actions to promote the development and growth of lawful and legitimate dollar-backed stablecoins worldwide." Section 5 promoted fair access to banking services for law-abiding crypto businesses and individuals.

#### Regulatory Review Directives <a href="#regulatory-review-directives" id="regulatory-review-directives"></a>

Section 7 of EO 14178 directed agencies to identify and recommend the rescission or modification of regulations and guidance that impede digital asset development. The implementation timeline was:

* Within 30 days (by approximately February 22, 2025): Agencies to identify regulations for rescission.
* Within 60 days: Initial regulatory actions.
* Within 180 days: Working Group report delivered to the President.

The regulatory review directives triggered a series of rescissions across the banking agencies in the weeks following, including the SEC's issuance of SAB 122 on January 23, 2025 (rescinding SAB 121), the OCC's issuance of Interpretive Letter 1183 on March 7, 2025 (rescinding IL 1179), and the Federal Reserve's rescission of SR 22-6 and SR 23-8 on April 24, 2025. _See_ [SEC](https://www.thecod3x.com/sec/), [OCC](https://www.thecod3x.com/occ/), and [the Fed](https://www.thecod3x.com/thefed/) for further discussion.

### Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (March 6, 2025) <a href="#strategic-bitcoin-reserve" id="strategic-bitcoin-reserve"></a>

On March 6, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order titled _Establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile_. _See_ White House, [_Executive Order on the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile_](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/establishment-of-the-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-and-united-states-digital-asset-stockpile/) (2025.03.06); 90 Fed. Reg. 11523 (published March 11, 2025); White House, [_FACT SHEET: President Donald J. Trump Establishes the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile_](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/03/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-establishes-the-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-and-u-s-digital-asset-stockpile/) (2025.03.06).

#### Structure and Capitalization <a href="#sbr-structure" id="sbr-structure"></a>

The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve was established as a "permanent reserve asset" of the United States, funded exclusively by the Treasury Department's forfeited bitcoin holdings. Government bitcoin deposited into the Reserve "shall not be sold" and shall be maintained as reserve assets. All agencies were directed to provide the Secretary of the Treasury and the Working Group a full accounting of all bitcoin in their possession within 30 days. The estimated initial holdings were approximately 207,000 BTC, valued at approximately $17 billion as of March 2025. David Sacks described the Reserve as a "digital Fort Knox."

The Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce were authorized to develop "budget-neutral strategies" for acquiring additional bitcoin, provided such strategies "impose no incremental costs on American taxpayers." The Treasury Department was assigned to administer and maintain custody of bitcoin, with separate offices within Treasury established for the Bitcoin Reserve and the Digital Asset Stockpile.

#### Digital Asset Stockpile <a href="#digital-asset-stockpile" id="digital-asset-stockpile"></a>

The executive order also established a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, separate from the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, composed of non-bitcoin digital assets owned by the Treasury from criminal or civil forfeiture proceedings. The government would not acquire additional assets beyond those obtained through forfeiture. President Trump stated that Ether (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) would be included.

Rep. Byron Donalds introduced legislation to codify the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile into law. Congressional reaction was mixed: supporters characterized it as forward-looking, while critics raised concerns about government holding volatile assets.

### White House Crypto Summit (March 7, 2025) <a href="#white-house-crypto-summit" id="white-house-crypto-summit"></a>

On March 7, 2025, the White House hosted the first-ever White House event dedicated to digital assets. Attendees included prominent crypto founders, CEOs, and investors. Companies represented at the summit had contributed more than $11 million in donations to Trump's inaugural committee. The crypto market initially reacted negatively to the summit, with bitcoin falling approximately 3%, as some investors were disappointed that the administration signaled no plans for actively purchasing bitcoin with government funds beyond forfeiture proceeds.

### David Sacks and the Presidential Council of Advisers <a href="#david-sacks-and-crypto-council" id="david-sacks-and-crypto-council"></a>

On December 5, 2024, President-elect Trump announced the appointment of David Sacks as White House Special Advisor for AI and Crypto. Sacks, a former PayPal executive and venture capitalist at Craft Ventures, was tasked with guiding policy and legal frameworks for both AI and the cryptocurrency industry. Sacks sold approximately $200 million in crypto-related holdings before taking the position, as disclosed in a March 2025 ethics memo. Senate Democrats launched an ethics investigation in September 2025.

Bo Hines was appointed in December 2024 as Executive Director of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets (the "Crypto Council"). Hines announced his resignation on August 9, 2025, after approximately eight months, to return to the private sector. Patrick Witt, former deputy director of the Crypto Council and acting director of the Office of Strategic Capital at the Department of Defense, succeeded Hines.

#### Working Group Report (July 30, 2025) <a href="#working-group-report" id="working-group-report"></a>

The Working Group on Digital Asset Markets delivered its report to the President on July 30, 2025, as required by EO 14178. _See_ Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, [_Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology_](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Digital-Assets-Report-EO14178.pdf) (2025.07.30); White House, [_FACT SHEET: The President's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets Releases Recommendations_](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/07/fact-sheet-the-presidents-working-group-on-digital-asset-markets-releases-recommendations-to-strengthen-american-leadership-in-digital-financial-technology/) (2025.07.30).

The report contained approximately 100 recommendations, including:

* **Stablecoins:** Faithful and expeditious implementation of the GENIUS Act.
* **Market Structure:** Recommended Congress enact market structure legislation (such as the CLARITY Act) to ensure the "most cost-efficient and pro-innovation regulatory structure for digital assets."
* **Banking Regulation:** Recommended regulators relaunch crypto innovation efforts to clarify permissible bank activities in custody, tokenization, stablecoin issuance, and blockchain use.
* **CBDC Opposition:** Firmly opposed any initiatives to establish, issue, or promote a U.S. CBDC, citing privacy, civil liberties, and prevention of government overreach.
* **Strategic Bitcoin Reserve:** Recommended administering the reserve consistent with the March 6, 2025 executive order, capitalized by forfeited digital assets.
* **Innovation:** Recommended safe harbors and regulatory sandboxes to allow innovative financial products to reach consumers.
* **DeFi:** Aimed to mainstream DeFi through appropriate regulatory treatment.

### GENIUS Act Signing (July 18, 2025) <a href="#genius-act" id="genius-act"></a>

On July 18, 2025, President Trump signed into law the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act ("GENIUS Act"), the first-ever federal legislation creating a regulatory framework for payment stablecoins. _See_ White House, [_FACT SHEET: President Donald J. Trump Signs GENIUS Act Into Law_](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/07/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-signs-genius-act-into-law/) (2025.07.18); SEC Chairman Paul Atkins, [_Statement on the GENIUS Act_](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-statement-genius-act-071825) (2025.07.18). The House of Representatives passed the bill on July 17, 2025.

Key provisions of the GENIUS Act include: one-for-one reserve requirements for stablecoins backed by U.S. dollars or other low-risk assets; issuer restrictions limiting issuance to federally or state-approved entities; explicit subjection of issuers to the Bank Secrecy Act; a requirement that issuers possess technical capability to seize, freeze, or burn stablecoins when legally required; an explicit exclusion of payment stablecoins from securities and commodity classifications; and a dual federal-state chartering system. _See_ [Treasury](https://www.thecod3x.com/treasury/) and [FSOC](https://www.thecod3x.com/fsoc/) for detailed discussion of the GENIUS Act's framework and implementation.

### Crypto Pardons <a href="#crypto-pardons" id="crypto-pardons"></a>

#### Ross Ulbricht (January 21, 2025) <a href="#ross-ulbricht-pardon" id="ross-ulbricht-pardon"></a>

On January 21, 2025 -- President Trump's first full day in office -- the President granted a full and unconditional pardon to Ross Ulbricht. Ulbricht, known by the pseudonym "Dread Pirate Roberts," created and operated the Silk Road dark web marketplace from 2011 to 2013. He was convicted of distributing narcotics, engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, computer hacking conspiracy, and money laundering conspiracy, and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The pardon fulfilled a campaign pledge Trump made to Libertarian and crypto supporters. The Ulbricht pardon generated debate among legal commentators: supporters argued the life sentence was disproportionate; critics expressed concern about the message it sent regarding dark web marketplace operations.

#### BitMEX Co-Founders (March 28, 2025) <a href="#bitmex-pardons" id="bitmex-pardons"></a>

On March 28, 2025, President Trump pardoned Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, and Samuel Reed, co-founders of the BitMEX cryptocurrency exchange. All three had pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act for failing to maintain adequate AML/KYC programs at BitMEX. The pardons signaled a departure from the Biden administration's enforcement posture toward crypto exchange operators.

#### Changpeng Zhao (October 23, 2025) <a href="#changpeng-zhao-pardon" id="changpeng-zhao-pardon"></a>

On October 23, 2025, President Trump pardoned Changpeng Zhao ("CZ"), founder of Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. Zhao had pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering at Binance and was sentenced to four months in prison, which he served. As part of his plea, Binance paid $4.3 billion in penalties. The pardon generated significant controversy. Rep. Maxine Waters alleged that Zhao "spent months lobbying Trump and his family while funneling billions into Trump's personal crypto company." Reports indicated Binance placed $2 billion in the World Liberty Financial stablecoin, a Trump family-linked venture. Sen. Elizabeth Warren stated that Zhao "boosted one of Donald Trump's crypto ventures and lobbied for a pardon."

### Additional Trump-Era Regulatory Actions <a href="#additional-trump-era-actions" id="additional-trump-era-actions"></a>

#### SEC Crypto Task Force (January 21, 2025) <a href="#sec-crypto-task-force" id="sec-crypto-task-force"></a>

On January 21, 2025, Acting SEC Chairman Mark Uyeda established a Crypto Task Force, led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, to develop a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto assets. _See_ [SEC](https://www.thecod3x.com/sec/), [_Crypto Task Force_](https://www.sec.gov/about/crypto-task-force) (2025.01.21). The Task Force published its top 10 priorities on February 6, 2025, held a spring roundtable series in Washington, D.C. in April and May 2025, and conducted a national "On the Road" tour from August through December 2025 concluding in Ann Arbor on December 5, 2025. Approximately 89 cryptocurrency enforcement cases were dropped or frozen under the new SEC leadership, including lawsuits against Coinbase and Kraken.

#### OCC Interpretive Letter 1183 (March 7, 2025) <a href="#occ-il-1183" id="occ-il-1183"></a>

On March 7, 2025, the [OCC](https://www.thecod3x.com/occ/) issued Interpretive Letter 1183, rescinding IL 1179 and removing the pre-approval requirement for bank crypto activities. IL 1183 reaffirmed the permissibility of crypto custody (IL 1170), stablecoin reserves (IL 1172), and DLT payments (IL 1174). _See_ OCC, [_Bulletin 2025-2_](https://occ.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2025/bulletin-2025-2.html) (2025.03.07).

#### Federal Reserve and FDIC Withdrawals (April 2025) <a href="#fed-fdic-withdrawals" id="fed-fdic-withdrawals"></a>

On April 24, 2025, [the Federal Reserve](https://www.thecod3x.com/thefed/) rescinded SR 22-6 and SR 23-8, removing advance notification and non-objection requirements for bank crypto activities. _See_ Federal Reserve, [_Press Release_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20250424a.htm) (2025.04.24). The Federal Reserve and [FDIC](https://www.thecod3x.com/fdic/) jointly withdrew from the January 3, 2023 and February 23, 2023 interagency statements. The Federal Reserve stated it would consider digital asset activities as part of "regular safety and soundness regulation."

#### OFAC Tornado Cash Delisting (March 21, 2025) <a href="#ofac-tornado-cash-delisting" id="ofac-tornado-cash-delisting"></a>

On March 21, 2025, [OFAC](https://www.thecod3x.com/ofac/) officially lifted sanctions on Tornado Cash, delisting over 100 Ethereum addresses from the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list. _See_ Department of the Treasury, [_Press Release sb0057_](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0057) (2025.03.21). The delisting followed the Fifth Circuit's November 2024 ruling that OFAC had overstepped its authority under IEEPA in designating immutable smart contracts as "property." Secretary Bessent stated: "Digital assets present enormous opportunities for innovation and value creation for the American people." Criminal charges against Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm remained pending as of the delisting date. _See_ [OFAC](https://www.thecod3x.com/ofac/) for further discussion of the Tornado Cash litigation.

## Policy Continuities and Reversals <a href="#policy-continuities-and-reversals" id="policy-continuities-and-reversals"></a>

### Policies Reversed <a href="#policies-reversed" id="policies-reversed"></a>

The transition from the Biden to the Trump administration in January 2025 produced the most comprehensive regulatory reversal in the history of U.S. digital asset policy. The following table summarizes the key reversals:

| Biden-Era Policy | Reversal Action | Date of Reversal |
|---|---|---|
| EO 14067 (comprehensive digital asset framework) | Revoked by EO 14178 | January 23, 2025 |
| Treasury Framework for International Engagement on Digital Assets (July 2022) | Revoked by EO 14178 | January 23, 2025 |
| CBDC research and development | Prohibited by EO 14178 | January 23, 2025 |
| SAB 121 (crypto custody accounting) | Replaced by SAB 122 | January 23, 2025 |
| SEC enforcement-by-regulation posture | Approximately 89 crypto cases dropped or frozen | January--March 2025 |
| OCC IL 1179 (pre-approval for bank crypto activities) | Rescinded by OCC IL 1183 | March 7, 2025 |
| OFAC Tornado Cash sanctions (August 8, 2022) | Delisted | March 21, 2025 |
| Joint Statement on Crypto-Asset Risks (January 3, 2023) | Withdrawn by OCC, Fed, and FDIC | March--April 2025 |
| Joint Statement on Liquidity Risks (February 23, 2023) | Withdrawn by OCC, Fed, and FDIC | March--April 2025 |
| Federal Reserve SR 22-6 (advance notification) | Rescinded | April 24, 2025 |
| Federal Reserve SR 23-8 (dollar token non-objection) | Rescinded | April 24, 2025 |

### Policies Continued <a href="#policies-continued" id="policies-continued"></a>

Notwithstanding the dramatic reversals, certain policy threads remained constant across both administrations:

* **Illicit Finance Enforcement:** Treasury's sanctions enforcement against North Korean and Russian illicit crypto activities continued, though with different emphases and framing.
* **AML/CFT Framework:** [FinCEN](https://www.thecod3x.com/fincen/)'s Bank Secrecy Act framework for virtual asset service providers remained in place and was explicitly preserved by the GENIUS Act.
* **Tax Reporting:** [IRS](https://www.thecod3x.com/irs/) crypto tax reporting requirements continued to expand under both administrations.
* **BSA/AML Obligations:** Bank Secrecy Act obligations for crypto exchanges continued, though enforcement intensity varied.
* **Stablecoin Priority:** Both administrations recognized the importance of U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins, though they approached regulation very differently.
* **Congressional Necessity:** Both recognized that comprehensive market structure legislation required Congressional action and could not be achieved through executive action alone.

### New Directions <a href="#new-directions" id="new-directions"></a>

The Trump administration initiated several policies with no precedent in the Biden era:

* **Strategic Bitcoin Reserve:** The designation of bitcoin as a permanent reserve asset of the United States, with a prohibition on selling government-held bitcoin, had no Biden-era equivalent.
* **CBDC Prohibition:** While the Biden administration explored CBDC development, the Trump administration categorically prohibited it -- a reversal from active research to affirmative prohibition.
* **Pro-Stablecoin Legislation:** The GENIUS Act established a dual federal-state chartering system for stablecoin issuers, diverging from the Biden-era PWG recommendation that issuers be insured depository institutions.
* **Working Group Architecture:** The Trump Working Group was housed in the NEC under an appointed "crypto czar," rather than distributed across national security and economic agencies as under Biden's EO 14067.
* **Regulatory Sandboxes:** The Working Group recommended safe harbors and regulatory sandboxes -- concepts the Biden administration did not pursue.
* **DeFi Mainstreaming:** The Trump administration sought to mainstream decentralized finance through appropriate regulatory treatment, while the Biden administration had focused on DeFi risk assessment and restriction.

## Presidential Appointments <a href="#presidential-appointments" id="presidential-appointments"></a>

Presidential appointments have been a critical mechanism through which both administrations have shaped digital asset policy at the agency level.
