# 1.22 - Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)

## Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the "OCC") charters, regulates, and supervises national banks and federal savings associations. Its engagement with cryptocurrency and digital assets has traced a dramatic arc: from a series of permissive interpretive letters in 2020-2021 authorizing banks to provide crypto custody, hold stablecoin reserves, and participate in blockchain networks, through a restrictive period of supervisory gatekeeping and interagency caution in 2021-2024, to a sweeping policy reversal beginning in early 2025 that rescinded the prior restrictions, expanded permissible activities, ceased reputation-risk examinations, and culminated in the conditional approval of five national trust bank charters for crypto-native firms in December 2025.

The OCC's regulatory posture has been shaped by three distinct leadership periods. Under Acting Comptroller Michael Hsu (2021-2025), the agency imposed a supervisory non-objection requirement through Interpretive Letter #1179 that effectively created a preclearance regime for bank crypto activities, and participated in cautionary interagency joint statements. Under Acting Comptroller Rodney Hood (February-July 2025), the OCC rescinded that requirement and withdrew from the joint statements. Under Comptroller Jonathan Gould (July 2025-present), the OCC has issued new interpretive letters progressively expanding permissible crypto activities, conditionally approved five national trust bank charters for digital asset firms, and begun implementing the GENIUS Act, which assigns the OCC supervisory authority over a new category of nonbank federal payment stablecoin issuers.

Although these publications -- interpretive letters, bulletins, and joint statements -- are useful in determining how the OCC will enforce the rules it has promulgated and its statutory mandate, they lack the force of law that a regulation that has gone through the public notice-and-comment period and is published in the Code of Federal Regulations does. However, with the GENIUS Act now law and several proposed rulemakings pending, the OCC is transitioning from an interpretive-letter-driven approach to a formal regulatory framework for digital assets.

## Interpretive Letters <a href="#interpretive-letters" id="interpretive-letters"></a>

The OCC has released a series of Interpretive Letters regarding crypto assets that apply to national banks and federal savings associations. The initial letters (2020-2021) addressed providing cryptocurrency custody services, holding stablecoin reserves, using node verification networks and stablecoins for payment activities, and chartering national trust banks. _See_ OCC, Interpretive Letter #1170, [_Authority of a National Bank to Provide Cryptocurrency Custody Services for Customers_](https://www.occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/interpretations-and-actions/2020/int1170.pdf) (2020.07.22); OCC, Interpretive Letter #1172, [_OCC Chief Counsel's Interpretation on National Bank and Federal Savings Association Authority to Hold Stablecoin Reserves_](https://www.occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/interpretations-and-actions/2020/int1172.pdf) (2020.09.21); OCC, Interpretive Letter #1174, [_OCC Chief Counsel's Interpretation on National Bank and Federal Savings Association Authority to Use Independent Node Verification Networks and Stablecoins for Payment_](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-2a.pdf) (2021.01.04).

Each concludes that banks are permitted to engage in these activities so long as they meet safety and soundness requirements. A fourth letter clarified the context in which banks are permitted to engage in these activities -- namely, with advance notice to a given bank's OCC supervisors and after receipt of a "no action" letter and review of the bank's ability to safely and soundly engage in the proposed activity. OCC, Interpretive Letter #1179, [_Chief Counsel's Interpretation Clarifying: (1) Authority of a Bank to Engage in Certain Cryptocurrency Activities; and (2) Authority of the OCC to Charter a National Trust Bank_](https://www.occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/interpretations-and-actions/2021/int1179.pdf) (2021.11.18). That non-objection requirement was rescinded in 2025; see the discussion of IL 1183 below.

Another interpretive letter that has generated significant controversy addresses what is necessary to charter a national trust bank. _See_ OCC, Interpretive Letter #1176, [_OCC Chief Counsel's Interpretation on National Trust Banks_](https://occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/interpretations-and-actions/2021/int1176.pdf) (2021.01.11).

A number of fintech companies, particularly those providing custody of digital assets, have sought to establish themselves as national trust banks. Although not mentioning cryptocurrency or digital assets specifically, this letter concluded that the OCC could charter a national trust bank even in the absence of the bank providing fiduciary responsibilities, opening the door for some of these fintech companies to seek and obtain a national charter. The OCC later clarified that this letter "did not expand or otherwise change existing banks' obligations under the OCC's fiduciary activities regulation." OCC, Interpretive Letter #1179, [_Chief Counsel's Interpretation Clarifying: (1) Authority of a Bank to Engage in Certain Cryptocurrency Activities; and (2) Authority of the OCC to Charter a National Trust Bank_](https://www.occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/interpretations-and-actions/2021/int1179.pdf) at 2 (2021.11.18).

### Letter #1170: Custody Services <a href="#letter-1170-custody-services" id="letter-1170-custody-services"></a>

In this letter, the OCC opines that banks are permitted to engage in custody services related to digital assets, at least in the following three ways: (1) providing secure storage for private keys to either hot or cold wallets; (2) taking direct control of cryptocurrencies and providing the customer indirect access; or (3) serving in a fiduciary capacity (e.g., trustee, will executor, estate administrator, receiver). _See_ OCC, Interpretive Letter #1170, [_Authority of a National Bank to Provide Cryptocurrency Custody Services for Customers_](https://www.occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/interpretations-and-actions/2020/int1170.pdf) at 7-9 & n.37 (2020.07.22). The OCC also noted that the services a bank may offer in connection with taking custody of cryptocurrency "may include services such as facilitating the customer's cryptocurrency and fiat currency exchange transactions, transaction settlement, trade execution, recording keeping, valuation, tax services, reporting, or other appropriate services." [_Id._](https://www.occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/interpretations-and-actions/2020/int1170.pdf) at 8 n.39.

The OCC reasoned that each of these activities was a natural extension of "longstanding authorities \[permitting banks] to engage in safekeeping and custody activities," and was consistent with its prior regulations permitting banks to "escrow encryption keys used in connection with digital certificates" and to "provide secure web-based document storage, retrieval and collaboration of documents and files containing personal information or valuable confidential trade or business information," interpretations it had codified at 12 CFR [7.5002(a)(4)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/12/7.5002) and [7.5005(a)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/12/7.5005). [_Id._](https://www.occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/interpretations-and-actions/2020/int1170.pdf) at 6-7 & n.28.

For fiduciary activities, banks must be careful to comply with the custody requirements of [12 CFR 9.13](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/12/9.13) and [12 CFR 150.230](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/12/150.230)-[250](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/12/150.250), which govern the segregation of assets and layers of control to those assets. And for all activities, the OCC conditioned engaging in them on complying with all applicable laws and doing so "consistent with sound risk management practices and align them with the bank's overall business plans and strategies as set forth in OCC guidance." [_Id._](https://www.occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/interpretations-and-actions/2020/int1170.pdf) at 9. Following the rescission of IL 1179 in March 2025, the prior non-objection requirement no longer applies, but banks must still conduct these activities in a safe, sound, and fair manner through the OCC's normal supervisory process.

### Letter #1172: Stablecoin Reserves <a href="#letter-1172-stablecoin-reserves" id="letter-1172-stablecoin-reserves"></a>

This letter addresses the situation in which an issuer of a stablecoin wishes to place a significant amount of cash reserves on deposit with a national bank "to provide assurance that the issuer has sufficient assets backing the stablecoin in situations where there is a hosted wallet." _See_ OCC, Interpretive Letter #1172, [_OCC Chief Counsel's Interpretation on National Bank and Federal Savings Association Authority to Hold Stablecoin Reserves_](https://www.occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/interpretations-and-actions/2020/int1172.pdf) at 1 (2020.09.21). The OCC approved national banks and FSAs taking on these deposits if the following conditions, largely designed to address compliance and liquidity risk, are met:

* the stablecoins are in hosted wallets;
* the stablecoin is backed on a 1:1 basis by a single fiat currency, and is redeemable on demand for the underlying fiat currency;
* the bank verifies daily that reserve account balances are always equal to or greater than the number of the issuer's outstanding stablecoins;
* the bank has conducted due diligence to understand the risks, including a compliance review of the Bank Secrecy Act and customer identification requirements under the USA PATRIOT Act as applied to cryptocurrency;
* the bank identifies and verifies beneficial owners of legal entity customers opening such accounts;
* and the bank ensures it complies with federal securities laws; and
* the bank has a risk analysis and plan to handle the liquidity risk of the deposits.

[_Id._](https://www.occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/interpretations-and-actions/2020/int1172.pdf) at 2-3. The letter does not clarify if this is all of the issuer's balances across all institutions, or if a stablecoin issuer is required to have reserves entirely on deposit with a single financial institution. The OCC cautions that insurance coverage will be an issue to take into account in how the deposits are structured, and that if done properly, pass through insurance may be available to underlying depositors. [_Id._](https://www.occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/interpretations-and-actions/2020/int1172.pdf) at 4.

From an examination standpoint, the OCC cautions that banks should be careful to "identify, monitor, and control the risks" associated with accepting stablecoin reserve deposits, particularly paying attention to the "significant liquidity risks" that such deposits could create by, for example, having "a cushion of unencumbered highly liquid assets without legal, regulatory, or operational impediments that can be sold or pledged to obtain funds in a range of stress scenarios." [_Id._](https://www.occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/interpretations-and-actions/2020/int1172.pdf) at 5 & n.24.

Finally, the OCC contemplates that banks and FSAs accepting such deposits should enter into contracts with the stablecoin issuer that allow the bank "to verify and ensure that the deposit balances held by the bank for the issuer are always equal to or greater than the number of outstanding stablecoins issued by the issuer" and include "mechanisms to allow the bank to verify the number of outstanding stablecoins on a regular basis," among other delineations of rights and responsibilities. [_Id._](https://www.occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/interpretations-and-actions/2020/int1172.pdf) at 5 & n.25.

In sum, the OCC will permit a bank to take on a stablecoin issuer as a customer, but significant due diligence work must be done upfront, and the bank must demonstrate it has a plan to mitigate the risk of taking on the deposits of the issuer. On March 31, 2022, BNY Mellon announced that it would take reserve deposits for Circle Internet Financial's USDC stablecoin, signaling it had satisfied the OCC's requirements and received the required no-action letter (then still required under IL 1179), the first bank to do so. _See_ Danny Nelson, Coin Desk, [_BNY Mellon to Custody Assets Backing Circle's USDC Stablecoin_](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/03/31/bny-mellon-to-custody-assets-backing-circles-usdc-stablecoin/) (2022.03.31). The GENIUS Act (signed into law on July 18, 2025) now imposes separate, comprehensive reserve and disclosure requirements on all payment stablecoin issuers; see the GENIUS Act section below.

### Letter #1174: Node Verification Networks & Stablecoins for Payments <a href="#letter-1174-node-verification-networks-stablecoins-for-payments" id="letter-1174-node-verification-networks-stablecoins-for-payments"></a>

This Letter focuses on one way that banks can remain financial intermediaries in blockchain and cryptocurrency -- a role they have held for centuries, if not millennia -- by participating in independent node verification networks (INVNs). _See_ OCC, Interpretive Letter #1174, [_OCC Chief Counsel's Interpretation on National Bank and Federal Savings Association Authority to Use Independent Node Verification Networks and Stablecoins for Payment_](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-2a.pdf) at 2 & n.9 (2021.01.04).

The OCC concludes that INVNs are essentially a new way for banks to participate in the international payments infrastructure, and thus "a bank may validate, store, and record payments transactions by serving as a node on an INVN," may convert stablecoins to fiat currency (and vice versa), and may "use INVNs and related stablecoins to carry out other permissible payment activities." [_Id._](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-2a.pdf) at 4, 7-8.

It even goes so far as to opine that banks could even issue their own stablecoin and exchange that stablecoin for fiat currency, because it is essentially just a different mechanism for electronically stored value, which is permitted by [12 CFR 7.5002(a)(3)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/12/7.5002). [_Id._](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-2a.pdf) at 6.

This openness, however, is tempered by a caution that banks must undertake to understand the risks that accompany this new activity, including compliance, anti-money laundering, and fraud risk, and consumer protection laws and regulations. [_Id._](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-2a.pdf) at 8-9. Additionally, the bank must ensure it has the technological expertise to operate a node securely and "in a safe and sound manner." Thus any "\[n]ew activities should be developed and implemented consistently with sound risk management practices." [_Id._](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-2a.pdf) at 9.

### Letter #1176: National Trust Banks <a href="#letter-1176-national-trust-banks" id="letter-1176-national-trust-banks"></a>

This interpretive letter clarified the OCC's chartering authority for national trust banks and set forth its position on the scope of (and required) activities for a national trust bank to achieve a charter. _See_ OCC, Interpretive Letter #1176, [_OCC Chief Counsel's Interpretation on National Trust Banks_](https://occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/interpretations-and-actions/2021/int1176.pdf) (2021.01.11). The letter states that national trust banks can engage in the activities of a state trust bank that are not considered fiduciary in nature, concluding that "\[i]f the state trust bank powers are permissible for national banks under 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh) . . . and are not fiduciary for purposes of 12 U.S.C. 92a and 12 C.F.R. Part 9, _**any national bank**_ can engage in those trust bank activities without fiduciary powers _**and without being subject to 12 C.F.R. Part 9**_." [_Id._](https://occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/interpretations-and-actions/2021/int1176.pdf) at 7 (emphasis added).

The letter had an interesting timing, coming only several weeks after BitPay National Trust Bank and Paxos National Trust, two digital asset focused entities, submitted applications to the OCC for a national trust bank charter, and just days before the end of the President Trump's administration. (The OCC granted Paxos [conditional approval](https://occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-49.html) for a charter in April 2021.)

It was also subject to significant criticism from traditional financial institutions, who saw the letter as a major departure from the OCC's past precedent. _See_ American Bankers Association, [_Joint Trades Letter to OCC re: Trust Charter Application_](https://www.aba.com/advocacy/policy-analysis/joint-trades-letter-to-occ-re-trust-charter-application) (2021.01.08). The letter was signed by the American Bankers Association, Credit Union National Association, Consumer Bankers Association CBA, Independent Community Bankers of America ICBA, National Association of Federally Insured Credit Unions, and The Clearing House. According to the trade groups, the significance of this position by the OCC was that traditionally, by OCC interpretation, trust banks could only engage in the fiduciary activities set forth in 12 U.S.C. 92a, and could not perform traditional non-fiduciary activities such as taking deposits or performing non-fiduciary custody services. [_Id._](https://www.aba.com/advocacy/policy-analysis/joint-trades-letter-to-occ-re-trust-charter-application) But by opening the door for trust banks to also perform custody services if permitted under state law, the OCC signaled that new entities could seek charters as national trust banks, perform no fiduciary services, and also engage in traditional banking activities -- without being subject to the normal regulations for conducting those activities. [_Id._](https://www.aba.com/advocacy/policy-analysis/joint-trades-letter-to-occ-re-trust-charter-application)

The objection from the trade groups did not, however, stop the OCC from granting Paxos National Trust a conditional charter. _See_ OCC, News Release 2021-49, [_OCC Conditionally Approves Chartering of Paxos National Trust_](https://occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-49.html) (2021.04.23).

In [Letter #1179](https://www.occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/interpretations-and-actions/2021/int1179.pdf) the OCC clarified that the scope of Letter #1176 was limited to its _chartering_ authority, not the ability of existing national banks to expand the scope of their activities, or of any change of the applicable regulations to banks already granted fiduciary powers.

### Letter #1179: Supervisory Non-Objection Requirement <a href="#letter-1179-supervisory-non-objection-requirement" id="letter-1179-supervisory-non-objection-requirement"></a>

Simultaneously with a joint statement with the [FDIC](https://www.thecod3x.com/fdic/) and [the Fed](https://www.thecod3x.com/thefed/) (see below), the OCC issued its fourth interpretive letter regarding the authority of banks to engage in crypto-asset activities. _See_ OCC, News Release 2021-121, [_OCC Clarifies Bank Authority to Engage in Certain Cryptocurrency Activities and Authority of OCC to Charter National Trust Banks_](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-121.html) (2021.11.23); OCC, Interpretive Letter #1179, [_Chief Counsel's Interpretation Clarifying: (1) Authority of a Bank to Engage in Certain Cryptocurrency Activities; and (2) Authority of the OCC to Charter a National Trust Bank_](https://www.occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/interpretations-and-actions/2021/int1179.pdf) (2021.11.18).

This letter clarified that although the OCC had previously stated banks and FSAs could engage in the foregoing cryptocurrency related activities, the banks must "demonstrate, to the satisfaction of its supervisory office, that it has controls in place to conduct the activity in a safe and sound manner" _**before**_ actually engaging in the activity, and should not engage in the activity "until it receives written notification of the supervisory office's non-objection." The letter notes that banks that had already engaged in the activity before issuance of the letter do not need to obtain supervisory non-objection, but should provide notice to its supervisory office. Letter #1179 at 1 and n.3.

In order to obtain a non-objection letter from its supervisory office, the bank must be able to demonstrate "that it has established an appropriate risk management and measurement process for the proposed activities." [_Id._](https://www.occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/interpretations-and-actions/2021/int1179.pdf) at 4. Specifically, banks should address the following cryptocurrency related risks:

* operational risk (e.g., the risks related to new, evolving technologies, the risk of hacking, fraud, and theft, and third party risk management);
* liquidity risk;
* strategic risk; and
* compliance risk (including but not limited to compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act, anti-money laundering, sanctions requirements, and consumer protection laws).

[_Id._ ](https://www.occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/interpretations-and-actions/2021/int1179.pdf)Making such a demonstration should involve preparing written documentation of the bank's "understanding of any compliance obligations related to the specific activities the bank intends to conduct," including the distinctions between different types of cryptocurrency the bank intends to use, how those differences may change compliance requirements, and how the bank intends to manage compliance. [_Id._](https://www.occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/interpretations-and-actions/2021/int1179.pdf)

**Rescission.** IL 1179 was rescinded in its entirety by IL 1183 on March 7, 2025. The supervisory non-objection requirement no longer applies. See the discussion of IL 1183 in the Policy Reversal section below.

## Interagency Joint Statements <a href="#interagency-joint-statements" id="interagency-joint-statements"></a>

In January and February 2023, the OCC joined [the Fed](https://www.thecod3x.com/thefed/) and the [FDIC](https://www.thecod3x.com/fdic/) in issuing two joint statements addressing risks associated with crypto-assets. Both statements were subsequently withdrawn by all three agencies in 2025.

### January 2023: Crypto-Asset Risks (OCC Bulletin 2023-1) <a href="#january-2023-crypto-asset-risks" id="january-2023-crypto-asset-risks"></a>

On January 3, 2023, the Fed, FDIC, and OCC issued a joint statement identifying key risks associated with crypto-assets and the crypto-asset sector. OCC, OCC Bulletin 2023-1, [_Joint Statement on Crypto-Asset Risks to Banking Organizations_](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2023/bulletin-2023-1.html) (2023.01.03). The statement identified the following risks:

* Risk of fraud and scams among crypto-asset sector participants;
* Legal uncertainties related to custody practices, redemptions, and ownership rights;
* Inaccurate or misleading representations and disclosures by crypto-asset companies;
* Significant volatility in crypto-asset markets;
* Susceptibility of stablecoins to run risk;
* Contagion risk within the crypto-asset sector from interconnections among participants;
* Lack of maturity and robustness of risk management and governance practices in the crypto-asset sector; and
* Heightened risks associated with open, public, and/or decentralized networks.

The agencies stated they were "neither prohibiting nor discouraging" banking services to any specific class or type of customer, provided services were delivered consistent with safe-and-sound banking practices and applicable law. [_Id._](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2023/bulletin-2023-1.html)

### February 2023: Liquidity Risks (OCC Bulletin 2023-8) <a href="#february-2023-liquidity-risks" id="february-2023-liquidity-risks"></a>

On February 23, 2023 -- less than three weeks before the collapse of Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature Bank -- the three agencies issued a second joint statement focused specifically on liquidity risks from crypto-asset-related deposits. OCC, OCC Bulletin 2023-8, [_Joint Statement on Liquidity Risks to Banking Organizations Resulting from Crypto-Asset Market Vulnerabilities_](https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2023/bulletin-2023-8.html) (2023.02.23). The statement highlighted risks including:

* Deposits placed by crypto-asset-related entities that benefit the entity's customers (e.g., deposits held for exchange customers);
* Deposits constituting stablecoin-related reserves; and
* The unpredictability of scale and timing of deposit inflows and outflows from crypto sources.

The statement emphasized that these were existing risk management principles, not new requirements. [_Id._](https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2023/bulletin-2023-8.html)

### March 2025: Withdrawal of Both Statements (OCC Bulletin 2025-2) <a href="#march-2025-withdrawal-of-both-statements" id="march-2025-withdrawal-of-both-statements"></a>

On March 7, 2025, the OCC withdrew from both interagency joint statements as they applied to national banks and federal savings associations. OCC, OCC Bulletin 2025-2, [_Bank Activities: OCC Issuances Addressing Certain Crypto-Asset Activities_](https://occ.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2025/bulletin-2025-2.html) (2025.03.07). The bulletin also rescinded OCC Bulletin 2023-1, OCC Bulletin 2023-8, and OCC Bulletin 2021-57 (which had transmitted IL 1179). [The Fed](https://www.thecod3x.com/thefed/) followed on April 24, 2025, rescinding its own supervisory letters (SR 22-6 and SR 23-7) that had imposed advance notification and non-objection requirements for bank crypto activities. The [FDIC](https://www.thecod3x.com/fdic/) withdrew from the joint statements in March-April 2025, also rescinding its prior crypto-related supervisory guidance including FIL-16-2022. The effect was a coordinated removal by all three federal banking agencies of the heightened scrutiny framework that had been erected in 2021-2023.

## 2023 Bank Failures <a href="#2023-bank-failures" id="2023-bank-failures"></a>

In March 2023, three banks with significant crypto-related deposit bases failed in rapid succession: Silvergate Bank (voluntary liquidation announced March 8), Silicon Valley Bank (closed March 10), and Signature Bank (closed March 12). These failures prompted significant congressional attention to bank engagement with crypto-assets.

### OCC's Limited Supervisory Role <a href="#occs-limited-supervisory-role" id="occs-limited-supervisory-role"></a>

None of the three banks were nationally chartered or OCC-supervised. Silvergate Bank and Silicon Valley Bank were California state-chartered banks supervised by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco; Signature Bank was a New York state-chartered bank supervised by the [FDIC](https://www.thecod3x.com/fdic/). The OCC's direct role was limited to chartering bridge banks as part of the FDIC resolution process -- on March 10, 2023, the OCC chartered the Deposit Insurance National Bank of Santa Clara and subsequently Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, National Association, at the request of the FDIC pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1821(m). _See_ OCC, [_Application to Charter Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, N.A._](https://occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/app-to-charter-silicon-valley-bridge-bank-na.pdf) (2023.03.10).

### Comptroller Hsu's Commentary <a href="#comptroller-hsus-commentary" id="comptroller-hsus-commentary"></a>

Acting Comptroller Hsu testified that "awareness and identification of weaknesses \[at SVB and Signature] were not the problem; rather timely and forceful supervisory action were \[needed\]." He subsequently emphasized the lessons of the failures for the crypto industry, arguing at the Institute of International Bankers Annual Washington Conference that crypto firms operating across jurisdictions without a "consolidated home-country supervisor" posed systemic risks analogous to the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), whose failure in 1991 led to the Foreign Bank Supervision Enhancement Act. _See_ Michael J. Hsu, [_Remarks at the Institute of International Bankers Annual Washington Conference: "Trust and Global Banking: Lessons for Crypto"_](https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2023/nr-occ-2023-23.html) (2023.03.06).

## Policy Reversal Under the Trump Administration <a href="#policy-reversal-under-the-trump-administration" id="policy-reversal-under-the-trump-administration"></a>

Beginning in February 2025, the OCC undertook a systematic reversal of the restrictive posture that had characterized the prior three years. This reversal was carried out through a combination of rescissions, new interpretive letters, supervisory bulletins, and charter approvals.

### IL 1183: Rescission of IL 1179 (March 7, 2025) <a href="#il-1183-rescission-of-il-1179" id="il-1183-rescission-of-il-1179"></a>

On March 7, 2025, Acting Comptroller Rodney Hood issued Interpretive Letter #1183, which expressly rescinded IL 1179 in its entirety. OCC, Interpretive Letter #1183, [_Rescission of Interpretive Letter #1179_](https://occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/interpretations-and-actions/2025/int1183.pdf) (2025.03.07); OCC, News Release 2025-16, [_OCC Clarifies Bank Authority to Engage in Certain Cryptocurrency Activities_](https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2025/nr-occ-2025-16.html) (2025.03.07). The letter:

1. Reaffirmed that the crypto-asset custody (IL 1170), stablecoin reserve (IL 1172), and distributed ledger/payment (IL 1174) activities are permissible for national banks and federal savings associations;
2. Eliminated the supervisory non-objection requirement -- banks may engage in these activities without first obtaining written non-objection from the OCC;
3. Stated the OCC has gained sufficient supervisory experience with these activities such that the preclearance process is no longer needed; and
4. Clarified that banks must still conduct crypto-asset activities in a safe, sound, and fair manner and in compliance with applicable law.

The OCC stated the letter's purpose was "\[t\]o reduce burden, encourage responsible innovation, and enhance transparency." Going forward, the OCC will examine crypto activities as part of its normal ongoing supervisory process rather than through a separate preclearance regime.

### New Interpretive Letters (IL 1184, 1186, 1188) <a href="#new-interpretive-letters" id="new-interpretive-letters"></a>

Following the rescission of IL 1179, the OCC issued three new interpretive letters progressively expanding the scope of permissible crypto-asset activities for national banks:

**IL 1184: Crypto-Asset Custody and Execution Services (May 7, 2025).** This letter confirmed that national banks may buy and sell crypto-assets held in custody at a custody customer's direction (i.e., execution services as part of custody), and may outsource bank-permissible crypto-asset activities, including custody and execution services, to third parties, subject to appropriate third-party risk management practices. OCC, Interpretive Letter #1184, [_Crypto-Asset Custody and Execution Services_](https://www.occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/interpretations-and-actions/2025/int1184.pdf) (2025.05.07); OCC, News Release 2025-42, [_OCC Clarifies Bank Authority to Engage in Crypto-Asset Custody and Execution Services_](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2025/nr-occ-2025-42.html) (2025.05.07). This extended the custody authority from IL 1170 to include execution and trading on behalf of customers.

**IL 1186: Holding Crypto-Assets as Principal for Network Fees and Platform Testing (November 18, 2025).** This letter was significant because it was the first to permit banks to hold crypto-assets as principal -- that is, on their own balance sheet -- rather than purely in a custodial capacity. A national bank may hold amounts of crypto-assets necessary to pay network fees (commonly known as "gas fees") on blockchain networks to facilitate otherwise permissible activities, and may also hold amounts necessary to test otherwise permissible crypto platforms. OCC, Interpretive Letter #1186, [_Authority to Hold Crypto-Assets as Principal for Network Fees and Platform Testing_](https://www.occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/interpretations-and-actions/2025/int1186.pdf) (2025.11.18); OCC, News Release 2025-108, [_OCC Confirms Bank Authority to Hold Certain Crypto-Assets as Principal for Purposes of Paying Crypto-Asset Network Fees_](https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2025/nr-occ-2025-108.html) (2025.11.18).

**IL 1188: Riskless Principal Crypto-Asset Transactions (December 9, 2025).** This letter confirmed that a national bank may engage in riskless principal crypto-asset transactions, in which the bank acts as principal in a crypto-asset transaction with one customer while simultaneously entering into an offsetting transaction with another customer. The bank serves as an intermediary and does not hold the crypto-assets in inventory, effectively permitting banks to facilitate crypto trading without taking on market risk. OCC, Interpretive Letter #1188, [_Riskless Principal Crypto-Asset Transactions_](https://www.occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/interpretations-and-actions/2025/int1188.pdf) (2025.12.09); OCC, News Release 2025-121, [_OCC Confirms Bank Authority to Engage in Riskless Principal Crypto-Asset Transactions_](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2025/nr-occ-2025-121.html) (2025.12.09).

### Cessation of Reputation Risk Examinations (OCC Bulletin 2025-4) <a href="#cessation-of-reputation-risk-examinations" id="cessation-of-reputation-risk-examinations"></a>

On March 20, 2025, the OCC announced it would no longer examine regulated institutions for reputation risk and would remove references to reputation risk from its Comptroller's Handbook booklets and guidance issuances. OCC, OCC Bulletin 2025-4, [_Bank Supervision: Removing References to Reputation Risk_](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2025/bulletin-2025-4.html) (2025.03.20); OCC, News Release 2025-21, [_OCC Ceases Examinations for Reputation Risk_](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2025/nr-occ-2025-21.html) (2025.03.20). Acting Comptroller Hood stated: "The OCC's examination process has always been rooted in ensuring appropriate risk management processes for bank activities, not casting judgment on how a particular activity may fare with public opinion." This action was significant for the crypto industry because reputation risk had been cited as a basis for banks declining to serve crypto-related businesses. In October 2025, the OCC and [FDIC](https://www.thecod3x.com/fdic/) jointly proposed a rule that would formally prohibit agencies from taking adverse action against institutions on the basis of reputation risk. _See_ OCC, OCC Bulletin 2025-30, [_Prohibition on Use of Reputation Risk by Regulators_](https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2025/bulletin-2025-30.html) (2025.10.07).

## National Trust Bank Charters <a href="#national-trust-bank-charters" id="national-trust-bank-charters"></a>

National trust banks are chartered under 12 U.S.C. 27 and are limited to the operations of a trust company and activities related thereto. They do not take deposits, offer checking or savings accounts, or have access to [FDIC](https://www.thecod3x.com/fdic/) deposit insurance. They may engage in fiduciary and certain nonfiduciary activities, including custody and safekeeping. The OCC's chartering of national trust banks for crypto-focused firms represents one of the most significant developments in digital asset regulation.

### Paxos <a href="#paxos" id="paxos"></a>

Paxos filed its initial application for a national trust bank charter with the OCC in December 2020. The OCC granted preliminary conditional approval in April 2021. _See_ OCC, News Release 2021-49, [_OCC Conditionally Approves Chartering of Paxos National Trust_](https://occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-49.html) (2021.04.23). However, the conditional approval expired on March 31, 2023 (at the expiration of the 18-month operational window under OCC rules) after Paxos failed to meet pre-opening requirements. During this period, in February 2023, the New York Department of Financial Services ordered Paxos to stop issuing Binance USD (BUSD) over compliance concerns, and Paxos ended its relationship with Binance. Paxos continued operating under its New York limited-purpose trust charter (held since 2015) until August 11, 2025, when it filed a new application to convert its NYDFS trust charter into an OCC national trust charter. That application was conditionally approved on December 12, 2025.

### December 2025: Five Conditional Approvals <a href="#december-2025-five-conditional-approvals" id="december-2025-five-conditional-approvals"></a>

On December 12, 2025, the OCC announced conditional approval of five national trust bank charter applications for crypto-focused firms -- the first time the OCC has granted conditional charter approvals to multiple crypto-native firms simultaneously, and a landmark development in digital asset regulation. OCC, News Release 2025-125, [_OCC Announces Conditional Approvals for Five National Trust Bank Charter Applications_](https://occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2025/nr-occ-2025-125.html) (2025.12.12).

**De Novo Applications (New National Trust Banks):**

1. **First National Digital Currency Bank, N.A.** (owned by Circle Internet Group) -- This charter would make Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, a nationally chartered trust bank supervised by the OCC.
2. **Ripple National Trust Bank, N.A.** -- Ripple, the company behind the XRP Ledger and the RLUSD stablecoin, would gain a national trust bank charter.

**Conversions (State Trust to National Trust Bank):**

3. **BitGo Bank & Trust, N.A.** -- BitGo, a major institutional digital asset custody and infrastructure provider, would convert from a state trust company charter.
4. **Fidelity Digital Assets, N.A.** -- The digital asset subsidiary of Fidelity Investments would convert from a state trust company charter.
5. **Paxos Trust Company, N.A.** -- Paxos would convert from its New York limited-purpose trust charter.

Three of the five -- BitGo, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Paxos -- intend to issue payment stablecoins, which would subject them to the requirements of the GENIUS Act.

Each charter is conditional; the applicants must satisfy pre-opening requirements before commencing operations, including: acquisition of fidelity bond coverage; adoption of policies, practices, and procedures for safe and sound operation; application for Federal Reserve membership; and securing other required regulatory approvals. [_Id._](https://occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2025/nr-occ-2025-125.html)

The significance of these approvals cannot be overstated. They represent the clearest signal that the OCC under Comptroller Gould intends to bring major crypto-native firms within the national banking framework. The Bank Policy Institute (BPI) raised concerns that the approvals could allow crypto firms to access the banking system without full bank regulatory requirements. Comptroller Gould has indicated that up to 14 companies have applied for bank charters, including additional crypto firms. In January 2026, the OCC issued a proposed rulemaking to amend its chartering regulations to clarify that national trust banks may engage in nonfiduciary activities such as asset custody and crypto-asset safekeeping. OCC, OCC Bulletin 2026-1, [_National Bank Chartering_](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2026/bulletin-2026-1.html) (2026.01.08).

## GENIUS Act Implementation <a href="#genius-act-implementation" id="genius-act-implementation"></a>

The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act of 2025 (the "GENIUS Act") was signed into law on July 18, 2025, creating a comprehensive federal regulatory framework for payment stablecoins. The Act significantly expands the OCC's regulatory responsibilities. _See_ GENIUS Act, [_S. 1582_](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/1582/text), 119th Congress (2025).

### Nonbank Federal Payment Stablecoin Issuers <a href="#nonbank-federal-payment-stablecoin-issuers" id="nonbank-federal-payment-stablecoin-issuers"></a>

Under the GENIUS Act, authority to issue payment stablecoins is restricted to three categories of entities: (a) subsidiaries of insured depository institutions regulated by a federal banking agency; (b) nonbank institutions supervised by the OCC; and (c) state-chartered entities subject to federally imposed standards or substantially similar state regimes. Nonbank entities may apply to the OCC for permission to issue payment stablecoins as a "federal qualified payment stablecoin issuer" (FQPSI). If approved, these nonbanks would be supervised by the OCC -- a significant expansion of OCC jurisdiction beyond its traditional oversight of nationally chartered banks and federal savings associations.

The Act requires issuers to hold high-quality, liquid assets (U.S. Treasuries, insured deposits, Federal Reserve balances, certain money market funds, and repurchase agreements backed by Treasuries) equivalent to 100% of outstanding stablecoins. Issuers must publish monthly attestations and undergo annual independent audits to verify reserve assets, and are treated as financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy Act for KYC/AML/sanctions compliance purposes.

### $10B+ Threshold for Federal Supervision <a href="#10b-threshold-for-federal-supervision" id="10b-threshold-for-federal-supervision"></a>

The Act establishes a tiered regulatory structure. Any bank or nonbank issuer that opts for the federal regime, or that has more than $10 billion in total outstanding issued payment stablecoins, is supervised by its primary federal banking regulator (or the OCC for nonbanks). Issuers with $10 billion or less in outstanding stablecoins may opt for regulation under a state regime, provided the state regime is "substantially similar" to the federal framework. Federal payment stablecoin regulators, including the OCC, must promulgate implementing regulations by July 18, 2026. [Treasury](https://www.thecod3x.com/treasury/) published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking public comment on GENIUS Act implementation on September 19, 2025. _See_ U.S. Department of the Treasury, [_GENIUS Act Implementation ANPRM_](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/09/19/2025-18226/genius-act-implementation) (2025.09.19). The Act becomes effective on the earlier of 18 months after enactment (January 18, 2027) or 120 days after federal agencies issue final regulations.

## Leadership <a href="#leadership" id="leadership"></a>

### Michael J. Hsu, Acting Comptroller (May 2021 - February 2025) <a href="#michael-hsu" id="michael-hsu"></a>

Michael J. Hsu served as Acting Comptroller of the Currency from May 10, 2021, through February 2025. He was not Senate-confirmed and served in an acting capacity throughout his tenure. Hsu adopted and maintained a "careful and cautious" approach to bank engagement with crypto-assets, overseeing the issuance of IL 1179's supervisory non-objection requirement and the 2023 interagency joint statements. He consistently emphasized the distinction between speculative crypto activity and tokenization of real-world assets, and called for consolidated supervision of global crypto firms. In September 2023, he announced the OCC would host a symposium on tokenization, stating: "There is an emerging divide between crypto and the tokenization of real-world assets and liabilities. Crypto remains driven by the promise of speculative gains . . . . By contrast, tokenization is driven by solving real-world settlement problems." OCC, News Release 2023-114, [_Acting Comptroller Announces Tokenization Symposium_](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2023/nr-occ-2023-114.html) (2023.09).

### Rodney E. Hood, Acting Comptroller (February - July 2025) <a href="#rodney-hood" id="rodney-hood"></a>

Rodney E. Hood was appointed as First Deputy Comptroller by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on February 10, 2025, making him Acting Comptroller under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. OCC, News Release 2025-9, [_Rodney E. Hood Announced as Acting Comptroller of the Currency_](https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2025/nr-occ-2025-9.html) (2025.02.10). Hood had previously served twice on the National Credit Union Administration Board (confirmed in 2005 and reconfirmed in 2019) and was designated NCUA Chairman by President Trump in 2019, the first African American to chair a federal banking regulatory agency. His key priorities included reducing regulatory burden, embracing bank-fintech partnerships, expanding responsible bank activities involving digital assets, financial inclusion, and addressing debanking. His most significant crypto-related actions were issuing IL 1183 (rescinding the supervisory non-objection requirement) and overseeing the cessation of reputation risk examinations. _See_ Michael J. Hsu, [_Remarks at the Exchequer Club Luncheon_](https://occ.gov/news-issuances/speeches/2025/pub-speech-2025-33.pdf) (2025.03).

### Jonathan V. Gould, 32nd Comptroller (July 2025 - Present) <a href="#jonathan-gould" id="jonathan-gould"></a>

Jonathan V. Gould was confirmed by the Senate on July 10, 2025, by a vote of 50-45, and was sworn in as the 32nd Comptroller of the Currency on July 15, 2025, for a five-year term. OCC, News Release 2025-70, [_Jonathan V. Gould Takes Office as the 32nd Comptroller of the Currency_](https://occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2025/nr-occ-2025-70.html) (2025.07.15). Gould previously served as Senior Deputy Comptroller and Chief Counsel at the OCC during the first Trump administration (2018-2021), where he oversaw the issuance of the initial crypto interpretive letters (IL 1170, 1172, and 1174). He was also a partner at Jones Day and a former executive at Bitfury Group, a blockchain technology company.

Gould's priorities have included reinvigorating de novo bank chartering for institutions with digital asset strategies, eliminating debanking from the federal banking system, implementing the GENIUS Act, and expanding permissible crypto activities through new interpretive letters. He has stated the financial system must "evolve from the telegraph to the blockchain" and has pushed back on traditional banks opposing crypto firms' pursuit of trust charters. In December 2025, he testified before the House Financial Services Committee on agency activities. _See_ OCC, News Release 2025-117, [_Comptroller Testifies on Agency Activities_](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2025/nr-occ-2025-117.html) (2025.12.02). Gould also confirmed findings from the House Financial Services Committee's "Operation Chokepoint 2.0" report, stating that "the Biden Administration's actions discouraged and prevented the institutions within the regulated banking system from engaging with digital assets." OCC, News Release 2025-114, [_Comptroller Issues Statement on Congressional Debanking Report_](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2025/nr-occ-2025-114.html) (2025.11.30).

## Statements <a href="#statements" id="statements"></a>

In November 2021, the OCC indicated that in 2022 it, in conjunction with the [FDIC](https://www.thecod3x.com/fdic/) and [the Fed](https://www.thecod3x.com/thefed/), planned to "provide greater clarity on whether certain activities related to crypto-assets conducted by banking organizations are legally permissible, and expectations for safety and soundness, consumer protection, and compliance with existing laws and regulations." The Fed, FDIC, & OCC, [_Joint Statement on Crypto-Asset Policy Sprint Initiative and Next Steps_](https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-ia-2021-120a.pdf) (2021.11.23). That clarified guidance was to include statements on the following categories:

* Crypto-asset safekeeping and traditional custody services.
* Ancillary custody services.
* Facilitation of customer purchases and sales of crypto-assets.
* Loans collateralized by crypto-assets.
* Issuance and distribution of stablecoins.
* Activities involving the holding of crypto-assets on balance sheet.

That guidance ultimately materialized in the form of the January and February 2023 interagency joint statements discussed above, which took a cautionary rather than permissive tone, focused on risks rather than authorizations, and were subsequently withdrawn by all three agencies in 2025.

Acting Comptroller Hsu made a number of public remarks on digital asset regulation during his tenure. Most notably, Hsu provided remarks at the DC Blockchain Summit in the wake of the collapse of the [algorithmic stablecoin](https://www.thecod3x.com/luna-terra-stablecoins/) TerraUSD. Michael J. Hsu, [_Remarks at the DC Blockchain Summit 2022: "Crypto: A Call to Reset and Recalibrate"_](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/speeches/2022/pub-speech-2022-60.pdf) (2022.05.24). There he focused on the fragmentation of the industry and the cross-chain bridges that appear "highly prone to being hacked"; the risk of contagion in market panic, which happened in the case of TerraUSD; and the lack of fully developed custody and ownership rights (noting in particular Coinbase's disclosure that if it filed bankruptcy, users could become unsecured creditors). He again stressed the need for cautious progress, citing back to Interpretive Letter 1179, and the need for banks to focus on "safety and soundness" before engaging in crypto assets. He warned that if crypto remains a "hype-driven economy" it will create "challenges for those interested in truly productive innovation and in protecting consumers" despite the "real potential for positive and transformative change with digital assets."

Those remarks followed Hsu's remarks on stablecoins and their parallels to how people generally treat bank deposits: as available on demand without risk. _See_ Michael J. Hsu, [_Remarks before the BritishAmerican Business Transatlantic Finance Forum Executive Roundtable: "The Future of Crypto-Assets and Regulation"_](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/speeches/2022/pub-speech-2022-2.pdf) (2022.01.13). Hsu noted there, however, that the firms responsible for stablecoins are not currently subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight. As a result, Hsu noted (what now appears quite presciently) that a sudden loss of trust in a given stablecoin could result in the equivalent of a bank run, without any current equivalent requirements for reserves, access to federal reserve liquidity, or FDIC insurance for "depositors."

Just two months earlier, Hsu addressed similar issues. _See_ Michael J. Hsu, Acting Comptroller, Remarks before the American Fintech Council Fintech Policy Summit 2021, [_Leveling Up Banking and Finance_](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/speeches/2021/pub-speech-2021-115.pdf) (2021.11.03). In those earlier remarks, Hsu noted that crypto firms are operating partially in regulatory territory and partially outside of it, leaving the regulators with an incomplete risk profile of the firm. _Id._ at 3-4, 8-9. In his view, though, no single agency should have oversight -- rather, a cooperative effort among regulatory agencies is necessary. The absence of comprehensive oversight makes it all too easy, Hsu argues, for firms to facilitate money laundering, obfuscate their financial condition, and encourage excessive risk taking. _Id._ at 9-10.

Following the FTX collapse in November 2022, Hsu compared the failure to that of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) in the 1990s, noting that both entities were "shadowy" institutions that concealed wrongdoing, operated multiple affiliate companies across jurisdictions, faced fragmented supervision, lacked a "home" regulator with a comprehensive view, and used multiple auditors to prevent holistic oversight. _See_ Michael J. Hsu, [_Remarks on FTX and Crypto_](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/speeches/2022/pub-speech-2022-125.pdf) (2022.11).

## Coordination with PWG and FDIC <a href="#coordination-with-pwg-and-fdic" id="coordination-with-pwg-and-fdic"></a>

In November 2021, the OCC coordinated with the President's Working Group on Financial Markets and the [FDIC](https://www.thecod3x.com/fdic/) to release a report on the uses, risks, and opportunities for stablecoins. _See_ President's Working Group on Financial Markets, the FDIC, and the OCC, [_Report on Stablecoins_](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/StableCoinReport_Nov1_508.pdf) (2021.11). The report outlines the various current use cases for stablecoins, documents their explosive growth over recent years, details the perceived risks (to users, to the payments system, and to the greater financial system), and issues a call to action to Congress to enact a "consistent and comprehensive regulatory framework" for stablecoins. That call was ultimately answered -- in modified form -- by the GENIUS Act in 2025.

The key aspects of that regulatory framework, as requested by the report, are:

* limiting stablecoin issuers (and those offering redemption and maintenance of reserve assets) to entities that are insured depository institutions, and making them subject to supervision at the depository and holding company levels;
* requiring custodial wallet providers for stablecoins to be subject to federal oversight, including restrictions on lending, compliance obligations for risk management, liquidity, and capital requirements;
* limits on custodial wallet providers' affiliation with commercial entities or on use of users' transaction data; and
* ensuring the federal supervisor of a stablecoin issuer has examination and enforcement authority to require issuers to meet risk-management standards, and also has the authority to implement standards to promote interoperability among stablecoins.

[_Id._](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/StableCoinReport_Nov1_508.pdf) at 16-17. The report also notes that the OCC "will seek to ensure that applicants \[for a banking charter] address the risks outlined by this report, including risks associated with stablecoin issuance and other related services conducted by the banking organization or third-party service providers." [_Id._](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/StableCoinReport_Nov1_508.pdf) at 18.

The report also notes that other federal regulatory agencies may have a role to play in oversight of stablecoins, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Securities Exchange Commission, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, Office of Foreign Assets Control, and [FinCEN](https://www.thecod3x.com/fincen/). The reference to FinCEN is of particular note, because FinCEN's regulations require registering with it as a money services business (MSB), establishing an anti-money laundering program, reporting cash transactions of $10,000 or more, and filing suspicious activity reports (SARs). [_Id._](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/StableCoinReport_Nov1_508.pdf) at 20. Doing so may cause downstream compliance issues because, as the report notes, "\[c]urrent \[Bank Secrecy Act] regulations require the transfer of certain specific information well beyond what can be inferred from the blockchain resulting in non-compliance." [_Id._](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/StableCoinReport_Nov1_508.pdf)

As discussed above, the interagency joint statements issued in January and February 2023 and the coordinated withdrawal of those statements in March-April 2025 reflect the evolution of the OCC's relationship with its fellow federal banking regulators: from a period of coordinated caution to a period of coordinated liberalization.
