# 1.26 - Financial Action Task Force (FATF)

## Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is not a United States agency. It is an intergovernmental organization established in July 1989 by the G7 summit in Paris to develop and promote policies combating money laundering, terrorist financing, and the financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Headquartered at the OECD in Paris, the FATF operates as the global standard-setter for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) frameworks. Its 39 members — comprising 37 jurisdictions and two regional organizations (the European Commission and the Gulf Co-operation Council) — together with nine FATF-Style Regional Bodies (FSRBs), form a global network covering more than 205 jurisdictions.

The FATF's core output is its 40 Recommendations, first issued in 1990 and substantially revised in 1996, 2003, and 2012. Although these Recommendations are not treaties and carry no direct force of international law, they achieve near-binding authority through a system of mutual evaluations (peer reviews that rate each member's technical compliance and effectiveness), grey and black lists that impose reputational and economic consequences on non-compliant jurisdictions, and G20 endorsement that effectively conditions participation in the global financial system on adherence to FATF standards. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund incorporate FATF assessments into their own country evaluations, amplifying the practical consequences of non-compliance.

For U.S. cryptocurrency practitioners, the FATF's significance cannot be overstated. FATF standards directly shape [FinCEN](https://www.thecod3x.com/fincen/) guidance, inform [Treasury](https://www.thecod3x.com/treasury/) policy, and establish the baseline expectations that foreign regulators apply to virtual asset businesses operating across borders. When FinCEN classifies cryptocurrency exchanges as money services businesses (MSBs), when the Bank Secrecy Act's Travel Rule is applied to virtual currency transmissions, and when [OFAC](https://www.thecod3x.com/ofac/) sanctions enforcement reaches into decentralized finance — the conceptual architecture underlying each of these actions traces back to FATF.

The watershed moment for global cryptocurrency regulation arrived in June 2019, when the FATF adopted its Interpretive Note to Recommendation 15 (INR.15) at its Plenary in Orlando, Florida. This document extended the full suite of AML/CFT obligations — customer due diligence, suspicious transaction reporting, record-keeping, sanctions screening, and the Travel Rule — to "virtual asset service providers" (VASPs). Every major jurisdiction's approach to crypto regulation since 2019, including the European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), Japan's Payment Services Act amendments, and Singapore's Payment Services Act, has been built upon or shaped by this FATF framework.

The FATF has continued to refine its approach through updated guidance in October 2021 (addressing DeFi, stablecoins, and NFTs), annual targeted updates on implementation progress, and a major revision to Recommendation 16 (the Travel Rule) agreed in June 2025. As of mid-2025, however, global implementation remains uneven: only 29% of jurisdictions are largely compliant with FATF's virtual asset standards, and 20% have opted to prohibit virtual asset service providers entirely rather than regulate them.

## What Is FATF <a href="#what-is-fatf" id="what-is-fatf"></a>

### Establishment and Membership <a href="#establishment-and-membership" id="establishment-and-membership"></a>

The FATF was created at the 15th G7 Summit in Paris on July 14-16, 1989, with a mandate to examine and develop measures to combat money laundering. Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, its mandate was expanded to encompass countering the financing of terrorism (CFT), and in 2012 it was further extended to cover countering the financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (CPF). FATF, [_History of the FATF_](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/the-fatf/history-of-the-fatf.html).

The FATF's current membership of 39 includes 37 jurisdictions and 2 regional organizations. Members include the G7 nations (United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan), as well as China, India, Australia, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, and others. Russia's membership was suspended in February 2023. Together with its nine FSRBs, the FATF's global network covers more than 205 jurisdictions.

### The 40 Recommendations <a href="#the-40-recommendations" id="the-40-recommendations"></a>

The FATF's 40 Recommendations constitute the core international AML/CFT standards. Originally issued in 1990 to address money laundering, they have undergone major revisions in 1996, 2003, and 2012. After 2001, the FATF added nine Special Recommendations on terrorist financing, which were subsequently integrated into the comprehensive 40 Recommendations during the 2012 revision. FATF, [_The FATF Recommendations_](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/Fatf-recommendations.html).

The Recommendations cover the full spectrum of AML/CFT obligations: risk assessment (Recommendation 1), customer due diligence (Recommendation 10), record-keeping (Recommendation 11), suspicious transaction reporting (Recommendation 20), wire transfer information requirements (Recommendation 16, the "Travel Rule"), and new technologies (Recommendation 15, which now governs virtual assets).

### How Standards Become Binding (Mutual Evaluations, Grey/Black Lists, G20 Endorsement) <a href="#how-standards-become-binding" id="how-standards-become-binding"></a>

Although FATF Recommendations are technically non-binding, four mechanisms give them practical force equivalent to binding international obligations.

First, the FATF conducts periodic **mutual evaluations** — peer-review assessments that rate each member's AML/CFT regime on both **technical compliance** (whether a country has enacted the right laws, rated from Compliant to Non-Compliant) and **effectiveness** (whether those laws work in practice, measured against 11 "Immediate Outcomes" rated from High to Low). Countries that fail evaluations face follow-up processes and remedial action requirements.

Second, countries identified as having strategic AML/CFT deficiencies are placed on the FATF's **grey list** (Jurisdictions Under Increased Monitoring) or **black list** (High-Risk Jurisdictions Subject to a Call for Action). As of February 2025, the black list includes Iran, Myanmar, and North Korea. Grey-listed countries face increased due diligence from correspondent banks, reduced access to international capital, and heightened scrutiny from international financial institutions — consequences severe enough to compel legislative reform.

Third, **G20 nations** have repeatedly endorsed FATF standards, and compliance is effectively a precondition for full participation in the global financial system. The World Bank and IMF incorporate FATF assessments into their own country evaluations.

Fourth, through **national implementation**, countries transpose FATF Recommendations into domestic law. In the United States, this occurs primarily through [FinCEN](https://www.thecod3x.com/fincen/) regulations under the Bank Secrecy Act. The practical effect of these four mechanisms is that FATF Recommendations function as de facto binding international standards — no jurisdiction can afford to ignore them without risking its standing in the global financial system.

For U.S. crypto practitioners, this means that FATF standard-setting activity is a leading indicator of domestic regulatory developments. When the FATF adopts a new standard or publishes updated guidance, U.S. rulemaking and enforcement actions that implement or echo those standards typically follow within months to years. Monitoring FATF publications is therefore essential to anticipating FinCEN guidance, [Treasury](https://www.thecod3x.com/treasury/) policy statements, and congressional action on cryptocurrency regulation.

## Early Work on Virtual Currencies (2014-2018) <a href="#early-work-on-virtual-currencies" id="early-work-on-virtual-currencies"></a>

The FATF's engagement with virtual currencies unfolded over approximately four years before culminating in the comprehensive 2019 framework. This early period was characterized by incremental steps — definitional work, followed by narrow guidance, followed by formal amendments to the Recommendations — each building on the last and each informed by the rapid growth of the cryptocurrency market.

### Key Definitions Report (June 2014) <a href="#key-definitions-report" id="key-definitions-report"></a>

The FATF's first formal publication addressing virtual currencies was its June 2014 report, _Virtual Currencies: Key Definitions and Potential AML/CFT Risks_. The report provided preliminary definitions and identified potential money laundering and terrorist financing risks arising from decentralization, pseudonymous transactions, and the global reach of virtual currency systems. While primarily a scoping exercise, the 2014 report established the analytical framework — focusing on risk identification and points of intersection with the regulated financial system — that would guide all subsequent FATF work on digital assets. FATF, [_Virtual Currencies: Key Definitions and Potential AML/CFT Risks_](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Methodsandtrends/Virtual-currency-definitions-aml-cft-risk.html) (2014.06).

### Risk-Based Approach Guidance (June 2015) <a href="#risk-based-approach-guidance-2015" id="risk-based-approach-guidance-2015"></a>

In June 2015, the FATF published its first comprehensive guidance on anti-money laundering prevention for virtual currencies. This guidance focused on the "points of intersection" between virtual currencies and the regulated financial system, identifying **convertible virtual currency exchangers** — entities operating fiat-to-virtual currency on-ramps and off-ramps — as the primary regulatory touchpoints. FATF, [_Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach to Virtual Currencies_](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfgeneral/Guidance-rba-virtual-currencies.html) (2015.06).

A key limitation of the 2015 guidance was its narrow scope: it addressed only convertible virtual currencies and fiat conversion points, not the broader virtual asset ecosystem. This meant that crypto-to-crypto exchanges, custodial wallet providers, peer-to-peer platforms, and other intermediaries operating entirely within the digital asset space were not squarely addressed. As the cryptocurrency market evolved rapidly between 2015 and 2018 — with the emergence of ICOs, decentralized exchanges, and a proliferating array of token types — the 2015 guidance became increasingly inadequate.

The U.S. was already ahead of the FATF on this front — [FinCEN](https://www.thecod3x.com/fincen/) had classified virtual currency exchangers and administrators as money services businesses in March 2013, making the United States one of the first jurisdictions to bring virtual currency intermediaries within its AML/CFT perimeter. This early U.S. action would inform the FATF's later, more comprehensive approach.

### Amendment to Recommendation 15 (October 2018) <a href="#amendment-to-recommendation-15-2018" id="amendment-to-recommendation-15-2018"></a>

At the G20 summit in Buenos Aires in July 2018, the G20 called on the FATF to clarify how its standards apply to "crypto-assets." The FATF responded at its October 2018 Plenary by amending Recommendation 15 (New Technologies) and adding two foundational definitions to the FATF Glossary. FATF, [_Regulation of Virtual Assets_](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/Regulation-virtual-assets-interpretive-note.html) (2018.10.19).

The October 2018 amendments were the first time the FATF formally incorporated virtual assets into its Recommendations, marking the transition from guidance (which is advisory) to standards amendments (which carry the weight of the mutual evaluation process). The new definitions were:

**Virtual Asset (VA):** A digital representation of value that can be digitally traded or transferred, and can be used for payment or investment purposes. Virtual assets do not include digital representations of fiat currencies, securities, and other financial assets already covered elsewhere in the FATF Recommendations. The exclusion of fiat-backed digital currencies and securities from the VA definition is significant: it means that central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), tokenized securities, and similar instruments fall under existing FATF frameworks rather than the VA-specific provisions.

**Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP):** Any natural or legal person who is not covered elsewhere under the Recommendations, and as a business conducts one or more of the following activities or operations for or on behalf of another natural or legal person:

1. exchange between virtual assets and fiat currencies;
2. exchange between one or more forms of virtual assets;
3. transfer of virtual assets;
4. safekeeping and/or administration of virtual assets or instruments enabling control over virtual assets; and
5. participation in and provision of financial services related to an issuer's offer and/or sale of a virtual asset.

These five covered activities form the backbone of the FATF's regulatory framework for digital assets and remain unchanged as of February 2026. U.S. practitioners should note that the VASP definition is broader than FinCEN's money transmitter classification in several respects — particularly activity (iv) (custody) and activity (v) (participation in token offerings), which do not map neatly onto FinCEN's MSB categories.

## The 2019 Framework: Virtual Assets and VASPs <a href="#the-2019-framework" id="the-2019-framework"></a>

### Interpretive Note to Recommendation 15 (June 2019) <a href="#interpretive-note-to-recommendation-15" id="interpretive-note-to-recommendation-15"></a>

On June 21, 2019, at its Plenary in Orlando, Florida, the FATF adopted the Interpretive Note to Recommendation 15 (INR.15). This was the watershed moment for global crypto regulation. The INR.15 clarified that FATF's full suite of AML/CFT requirements applies to virtual assets and VASPs, establishing six core obligations:

1. **Risk Assessment:** Countries must identify, assess, and understand the ML/TF risks associated with virtual asset activities and VASPs (applying the Recommendation 1 risk-based approach).
2. **Licensing or Registration:** Countries must ensure VASPs are licensed or registered, at minimum in the jurisdiction where they are created. Countries must maintain systems to prevent criminals or their associates from holding significant or controlling interests in, or management functions at, a VASP (the "fit and proper" requirement).
3. **AML/CFT Obligations:** VASPs must apply all preventive measures under Recommendations 10-21, including customer due diligence (CDD) and know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, record-keeping, suspicious transaction reporting (STR), and screening against targeted financial sanctions lists.
4. **Travel Rule:** INR.15 explicitly requires VASP compliance with Recommendation 16 for VA transfers (discussed in detail in the Travel Rule section below).
5. **Threshold:** A USD/EUR 1,000 threshold applies for occasional VA transactions, above which VASPs must conduct customer due diligence (Recommendation 10). Transactions below this threshold may still require limited originator and beneficiary information.
6. **Supervision:** Countries must designate competent authorities to supervise or monitor VASPs for AML/CFT compliance and take appropriate supervisory, administrative, or enforcement action against non-compliant VASPs.

The INR.15 represented a paradigm shift: for the first time, the full weight of global AML/CFT standards applied to virtual asset intermediaries on the same basis as traditional financial institutions. The practical effect was to place VASPs worldwide on notice that they would be expected to implement compliance programs comparable to those of banks, broker-dealers, and money transmitters.

### Virtual Asset and VASP Definitions <a href="#va-and-vasp-definitions" id="va-and-vasp-definitions"></a>

The INR.15 confirmed the VA and VASP definitions adopted in October 2018, described in full above. Two aspects merit emphasis for U.S. practitioners. First, the VA definition is technology-neutral and function-based — it captures any digital representation of value used for payment or investment purposes, regardless of the underlying technology. Second, the VASP definition's residual clause ("not covered elsewhere under the Recommendations") means that entities already regulated as financial institutions (such as banks offering crypto custody) are subject to existing FATF obligations and need not be separately classified as VASPs.

### Five Covered Activities <a href="#five-covered-activities" id="five-covered-activities"></a>

The VASP definition's five covered activities merit individual attention because they determine the scope of FATF regulatory coverage:

**(i) Exchange between virtual assets and fiat currencies** — This is the traditional fiat on-ramp/off-ramp function (e.g., purchasing Bitcoin with U.S. dollars). In U.S. terms, this maps to FinCEN's classification of exchangers as money transmitters.

**(ii) Exchange between one or more forms of virtual assets** — This captures crypto-to-crypto trading (e.g., swapping ETH for USDC). This activity extended the regulatory perimeter well beyond the 2015 guidance's focus on fiat conversion points.

**(iii) Transfer of virtual assets** — This captures the transmission function (e.g., sending Bitcoin from one person to another through an intermediary). It aligns with FinCEN's money transmission classification.

**(iv) Safekeeping and/or administration of virtual assets or instruments enabling control over virtual assets** — This captures custodial services. While FinCEN does not have a standalone "custody" category, custodial wallet providers are generally treated as money transmitters under existing guidance.

**(v) Participation in and provision of financial services related to an issuer's offer and/or sale of a virtual asset** — This captures initial coin offerings (ICOs), token sales, and similar issuance activities. This activity has no direct FinCEN analog and illustrates the broader reach of the FATF framework.

### Accompanying Guidance (June 2019) <a href="#accompanying-guidance-2019" id="accompanying-guidance-2019"></a>

Alongside the INR.15, the FATF published approximately 60 pages of practical implementation guidance. The June 2019 guidance provided detailed discussion of the five VASP activities with examples, guidance on applying the risk-based approach to virtual assets, guidance on Travel Rule implementation for VASPs, and a critical clarification: protocol developers and those who merely publish software that creates new virtual assets or new virtual asset networks should **not** be captured in the VASP definition. FATF, [_Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach to Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers_](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/Guidance-rba-virtual-assets.html) (2019.06).

This developer carve-out has been a focal point in U.S. regulatory debates. It implies that publishing open-source code — even code that enables virtual asset transactions — does not, standing alone, make one a VASP. The practical boundaries of this carve-out, however, remain contested. The distinction between "merely publishing software" and "providing or actively facilitating VASP services" through that software is the central question in numerous U.S. enforcement actions and policy debates concerning DeFi protocol developers, wallet developers, and infrastructure providers.

The June 2019 guidance also clarified that the VASP definition should be read functionally: it is the activity, not the technology or business model, that triggers regulatory obligations. This principle — that regulatory classification follows function rather than form — has become the analytical cornerstone for both FATF and U.S. regulatory approaches to emerging crypto business models.

## The Travel Rule for Virtual Assets (Recommendation 16) <a href="#the-travel-rule" id="the-travel-rule"></a>

### Requirements <a href="#travel-rule-requirements" id="travel-rule-requirements"></a>

The "Travel Rule" derives from Recommendation 16, which historically required financial institutions to include originator and beneficiary information with wire transfers. The June 2019 INR.15 extended this requirement to virtual asset transfers conducted by VASPs.

Under Recommendation 16 as applied to virtual assets, **originating VASPs** must obtain and hold required and accurate originator information and required beneficiary information on VA transfers. **Beneficiary VASPs** must obtain and hold required originator information and required and accurate beneficiary information, and must make it available on request to appropriate authorities. This information must be transmitted immediately and securely alongside — or in connection with — the VA transfer.

For VA transfers above the applicable threshold, the required information includes: (1) the originator's name; (2) the originator's account number (e.g., wallet address) used to process the transaction; (3) the originator's physical address, national identity number, customer identification number, or date and place of birth; (4) the beneficiary's name; and (5) the beneficiary's account number used to process the transaction.

While FATF recommends a threshold of USD/EUR 1,000, jurisdictions have implemented widely varying thresholds:

| Jurisdiction          | Threshold                | Notes                                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| FATF Standard         | USD/EUR 1,000            | Recommended minimum                                  |
| United States         | $3,000                   | BSA Travel Rule; proposed $250 for cross-border (not finalized) |
| European Union (TFR)  | EUR 0 (zero threshold)   | Every crypto transaction requires full compliance    |
| Japan                 | JPY 0 (no threshold)     | Full compliance for all transactions                 |
| Singapore             | SGD 1,500 (~USD 1,100)   | Aligned with FATF standard                           |
| Switzerland           | CHF/EUR/USD 1,000        | Also applies to linked transactions                  |
| Canada                | CAD 1,000                | Aligned with FATF standard                           |

The threshold discrepancy between the United States ($3,000) and the FATF standard ($1,000) — and particularly the EU's zero threshold — creates practical compliance challenges for U.S. VASPs operating internationally. A U.S. exchange processing a $1,500 transfer to a European counterparty faces no domestic Travel Rule obligation but must comply with the EU's zero-threshold requirement. This asymmetry is one reason FinCEN proposed lowering the cross-border threshold to $250 in December 2020, though that proposal remains unfinalized.

### Implementation Challenges (Sunrise Problem, Interoperability) <a href="#implementation-challenges" id="implementation-challenges"></a>

The Travel Rule has proven to be the single most challenging aspect of the FATF virtual asset framework to implement in practice. Four principal challenges have emerged.

First, unlike traditional wire transfers, there is no single messaging standard for transmitting Travel Rule information alongside VA transfers. The private sector has developed multiple competing technological solutions — including TRISA, Shyft/Veriscope, Sygna, Notabene, and OpenVASP — but **interoperability** between these solutions remains limited. A VASP using TRISA cannot easily communicate the required information to a counterparty using Notabene, creating friction and compliance gaps.

Second, transfers to and from wallets not associated with a VASP (variously termed "unhosted," "self-hosted," or "non-custodial" wallets) create fundamental compliance gaps. When a user sends virtual assets from a VASP to their own self-hosted wallet, there is no counterparty VASP to receive the required information.

Third, the **"sunrise problem"** describes the dilemma that arises from uneven global implementation. VASPs in jurisdictions that have implemented the Travel Rule cannot effectively comply when transacting with VASPs in jurisdictions that have not, because the counterparty VASP has no legal obligation to participate in the information exchange. As of June 2025, 73% of surveyed jurisdictions (85 of 117, excluding those that prohibit VASPs) have passed Travel Rule legislation, but enforcement remains limited — a significant improvement from 2022 (30%) but still far short of universal adoption.

Fourth, there is no global registry of VASPs, making it difficult for an originating VASP to identify whether a beneficiary address is associated with a regulated counterparty VASP and, if so, how to communicate the required information. Without a counterparty discovery mechanism, originating VASPs cannot determine whether they are sending to an unhosted wallet (where no counterparty obligations arise) or to a VASP-controlled address (where full Travel Rule compliance is required). Several private-sector initiatives are attempting to address this gap, but no universally adopted solution exists.

These challenges are not merely technical — they are structural. The Travel Rule was designed for a financial system where intermediaries are known, identifiable, and interconnected through established messaging networks (e.g., SWIFT). The virtual asset ecosystem, by contrast, was architected to enable direct, permissionless transfers without intermediary knowledge or consent. Adapting a rule designed for the former to the latter requires not only new technology but also new institutional arrangements that may take years to mature.

### Global Implementation Progress <a href="#global-implementation-progress" id="global-implementation-progress"></a>

The FATF has tracked Travel Rule implementation through annual targeted updates. Progress has been gradual but accelerating:

| Year | Survey Respondents | Passed Travel Rule Legislation | Enforcement Active | VASP Prohibition Rate |
| ---- | ------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| 2022 | 98                 | 29 (30%)                       | 11 (\~11%)         | 7%                    |
| 2023 | 151                | 35 (23%); 27 in process        | Limited            | 11%                   |
| 2024 | 94 (excl. prohibitors) | 65 (70%)                  | 17 (26% of those with legislation) | 14% |
| 2025 | 117 (excl. prohibitors) | 85 (73%); 14 in process  | Improving but still limited | 20% |

A notable trend is the steady increase in jurisdictions opting to **prohibit** VASPs outright rather than regulate them — rising from 7% in 2022 to 20% in 2025. This suggests that some countries, particularly those with limited regulatory capacity, view the compliance costs of FATF's framework as prohibitive. For U.S. practitioners, the uneven global implementation landscape means that counterparty due diligence must include an assessment of whether a foreign VASP's home jurisdiction has implemented the Travel Rule and, if so, whether it is enforcing compliance. The FATF's annual targeted updates provide a useful (though not exhaustive) resource for this assessment.

### June 2025 Revision <a href="#june-2025-revision" id="june-2025-revision"></a>

In June 2025, the FATF agreed to a major revision of Recommendation 16. The revised standard expands the scope of the Travel Rule from "wire transfers" to all "payments or value transfers and related messages," explicitly and comprehensively covering VA transfers. FATF, [_Update to Recommendation 16 on Payment Transparency_](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/update-Recommendation-16-payment-transparency-june-2025.html) (2025.06).

Key changes include:

* **Scope expansion:** The revised R.16 now applies to all "payments or value transfers and related messages," not just wire transfers — explicitly and comprehensively covering VA transfers.
* **Enhanced information requirements:** New mandatory fields for payments over EUR 1,000, including originator's address, date of birth, and Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs), aligned with ISO 20022 messaging standards.
* **Clarified responsibilities:** The revision specifies who in the payment chain is responsible for including information and ensuring it remains unchanged.
* **Enhanced beneficiary requirements:** New obligations on beneficiary financial institutions to use received information for compliance purposes.
* **Implementation deadline:** End of 2030 for full implementation.

For U.S. practitioners, the June 2025 revision reinforces the trajectory toward more comprehensive information-sharing requirements for virtual asset transfers. The alignment with ISO 20022 messaging standards signals a move toward standardizing the data formats used in VA transfers, which could help address the interoperability challenges that have plagued Travel Rule implementation. FinCEN's existing BSA Travel Rule requirements will likely need updating to align with the expanded FATF standard, and the 2030 deadline establishes a concrete timeline within which domestic regulatory changes can be anticipated.

## Updated Guidance on Virtual Assets and VASPs (October 2021) <a href="#updated-guidance-2021" id="updated-guidance-2021"></a>

On October 28, 2021, the FATF published its _Updated Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach to Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers_ — a 110-page document that replaced the June 2019 guidance and remains the primary FATF reference document for virtual asset regulation as of February 2026. FATF, [_Updated Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach to Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers_](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/Guidance-rba-virtual-assets-2021.html) (2021.10.28).

The 2021 guidance addressed six areas: (1) clarification of VA and VASP definitions for emerging asset types; (2) stablecoins; (3) peer-to-peer transaction risks; (4) licensing and registration of VASPs; (5) Travel Rule implementation; and (6) information-sharing and cooperation among VASP supervisors. Three of these areas — DeFi, stablecoins, and NFTs — deserve particular attention.

### DeFi Coverage (Control or Sufficient Influence Test) <a href="#defi-coverage" id="defi-coverage"></a>

The FATF's approach to decentralized finance, articulated in the October 2021 guidance, applies a functional, substance-over-form analysis that is highly relevant to ongoing U.S. regulatory debates.

The core principle is **technology neutrality**: the FATF Standards "do not apply to underlying software or technology." A DeFi protocol or smart contract is not, in itself, a VASP. The regulatory inquiry focuses on **who** is providing VASP services, not the technology through which they are delivered.

However, "creators, owners and operators or some other persons who maintain control or sufficient influence in the DeFi arrangements may fall under the FATF definition of a VASP where they are providing or actively facilitating VASP services." Self-labeling as "DeFi" or "decentralized" is expressly not determinative.

The 2021 guidance identifies several indicators of "control or sufficient influence," including: exercising control over assets or the protocol; having an ongoing business relationship with users; profiting from the service; the ability to set or change parameters such as fees; and maintaining administrative keys or governance functions.

Critically, the guidance acknowledges a **"truly decentralized" carve-out**: if a DeFi arrangement is truly decentralized — meaning no person or entity has control or sufficient influence — it may not be captured by the VASP definition. However, the FATF notes that truly decentralized arrangements are rare in practice. Countries are expected to monitor and understand the ML/TF risks from such arrangements regardless.

The practical difficulty lies in determining where, on the spectrum from fully centralized to truly decentralized, any given protocol falls. The FATF guidance does not establish bright-line rules; instead, it relies on a multi-factor assessment that weighs the totality of circumstances. This creates uncertainty for protocol developers and governance participants who may not know, ex ante, whether their level of involvement triggers VASP classification.

This framework has direct implications for U.S. crypto practitioners. FinCEN's treatment of DeFi protocols — and the broader question of when a DeFi developer, governance token holder, or front-end operator crosses the line into money transmission — tracks the same functional inquiry articulated by the FATF. The "control or sufficient influence" test provides the conceptual foundation for enforcement actions against nominally decentralized protocols where identifiable persons maintain operational control. When the U.S. Department of Justice or FinCEN brings an action against a DeFi protocol operator for operating an unregistered money transmitting business, the analytical framework mirrors the FATF's: the inquiry is whether the defendant maintained control or sufficient influence over the arrangement, not whether the protocol self-identified as decentralized.

The FATF's DeFi framework also has implications for governance token holders. If governance tokens confer the ability to set or change protocol parameters, fee structures, or access controls, the holders exercising those governance rights may collectively maintain "sufficient influence" to trigger VASP classification. This remains an unresolved and actively debated question in both FATF policy discussions and U.S. regulatory enforcement.

### Stablecoin Coverage <a href="#stablecoin-coverage" id="stablecoin-coverage"></a>

The 2021 guidance provides that central developers or governance bodies of stablecoin arrangements are "in general, considered VASPs." For stablecoins without a readily identifiable central body, the party that develops and launches the arrangement "likely carries out VASP functions." The FATF Standards apply regardless of the particular technology or name used for the asset. FATF's June 2025 targeted update further highlighted stablecoin risks, identifying stablecoins as the dominant vehicle for on-chain illicit activity and noting approximately $51 billion in illicit on-chain activity relating to fraud and scams in 2024.

The FATF addressed stablecoins separately in a July 2020 report to the G20, deliberately using the term "so-called stablecoins" to underscore that "stablecoin" is not a clear legal or technical category but rather a "marketing term." The report found that existing FATF Standards on VAs and VASPs "clearly apply" to stablecoin arrangements, that stablecoins present ML/TF risks due to their potential for anonymity, global reach, and layering of illicit funds, and that mass adoption could amplify these risks significantly. FATF, [_Report to the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors on So-called Stablecoins_](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Virtualassets/Report-g20-so-called-stablecoins-june-2020.html) (2020.07.07).

The June 2025 targeted update underscored the prescience of these concerns, reporting that the majority of all on-chain illicit activity was transacted in stablecoins and that stablecoin transaction volume had grown by $30 trillion between May 2024 and May 2025. The FATF's current work programme includes a targeted paper on stablecoins expected between October 2025 and June 2026.

### NFT Coverage <a href="#nft-coverage" id="nft-coverage"></a>

The FATF's position on non-fungible tokens is that NFTs are "generally not considered to be VAs under the FATF definition." NFTs that are unique and used as collectibles rather than as payment or investment instruments do not fall under the VA category.

However, NFTs may be considered virtual assets when they are "used for payment or investment purposes in practice," when they function as virtual assets regardless of their labeling, or when they are traded on secondary markets (which increases the likelihood that they function as VAs). Fractional NFTs or NFTs that are part of large, fungible collections (e.g., 10,000-item generative art collections) may more closely resemble virtual assets due to their investment characteristics and effective fungibility. An NFT that is a digital representation of another financial asset already covered by FATF Standards would be treated under those existing standards rather than the VA framework.

Operators of NFT marketplaces may qualify as VASPs if the NFTs traded on their platforms are VAs. The determination must be made on a case-by-case basis, with jurisdictions required to "consider the nature of the NFT and its function in practice" when assessing whether it qualifies as a VA. The FATF acknowledges the "rapid development and evolving functions/forms of NFTs" and commits to continuous monitoring as the market evolves. _See also_ [Treasury](https://www.thecod3x.com/treasury/), which has adopted substantially the same analytical framework in its own NFT guidance, concluding that depending on the nature of NFTs offered, platforms "may be considered virtual asset service providers (VASP) by FATF and may come under FinCEN's regulations."

### Peer-to-Peer Transaction Concerns <a href="#p2p-transaction-concerns" id="p2p-transaction-concerns"></a>

The FATF defines peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions as VA transfers "conducted without the use or involvement of a VASP or other obliged entity" — for example, VA transfers between two self-hosted wallets whose users are acting on their own behalf. The FATF acknowledges that P2P transactions occur outside the jurisdictional AML/CFT control framework because there is no intermediary to regulate. The illicit share of P2P transactions appears "potentially higher" than VASP-intermediated transactions.

The guidance further warns that self-described "P2P platforms" should be evaluated based on underlying activity rather than labels. Entities or individuals that provide matching or facilitation services may be considered VASPs even if they do not act as direct intermediaries. Countries should review and understand the degree of AML/CFT risk presented by P2P transactions, consider tools and strategies to mitigate those risks, and monitor the volume and nature of P2P activity. Blockchain transparency provides a partial mitigation, but the FATF views P2P transactions as a growing area of concern.

Per the June 2025 targeted update, the FATF and VACG plan to produce targeted papers on DeFi between October 2025 and June 2026, suggesting that additional, more specific guidance on DeFi regulation is forthcoming. This is an area of significant ongoing development, and U.S. practitioners should monitor these publications closely.

## Targeted Reviews and Updates (2022-2026) <a href="#targeted-reviews" id="targeted-reviews"></a>

### 12-Month Reviews (2020-2021) <a href="#12-month-reviews" id="12-month-reviews"></a>

Following the adoption of the 2019 framework, the FATF conducted two annual reviews to assess implementation progress across its Global Network.

The **first 12-month review** (July 2020) found that implementation of the revised standards had begun but was "uneven," with many jurisdictions having not yet begun implementing the revised standards. The FATF committed to producing updated guidance addressing stablecoins, anonymous peer-to-peer transactions, and Travel Rule implementation challenges. FATF, [_12-Month Review of the Revised FATF Standards on Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers_](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/12-month-review-virtual-assets-vasps.html) (2020.07).

Alongside the first review, the FATF published a _Red Flag Indicators_ report in September 2020, based on over 100 case studies collected since 2017. The report identified red flag indicators across six categories: transaction-related indicators, transaction pattern indicators, anonymity-related indicators (including use of mixing/tumbling services and privacy-enhanced cryptocurrencies), sender/recipient indicators, source of funds/wealth indicators, and geographical risk indicators. The report cautioned that the mere presence of a red flag indicator is not itself a basis for suspicion of ML/TF — context matters. FATF, [_Virtual Assets — Red Flag Indicators of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing_](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Methodsandtrends/Virtual-assets-red-flag-indicators.html) (2020.09.14).

The **second 12-month review** (July 5, 2021) found that 58 of 128 reporting jurisdictions had implemented the revised standards (52 regulating VASPs, 6 prohibiting them), while 70 jurisdictions had not yet implemented the standards at all. The review noted that Travel Rule technological solutions were developing but that adoption was lagging because jurisdictional non-implementation was "disincentivizing" private-sector investment in compliance infrastructure — a circular problem. The review also flagged that "a potentially significant amount of virtual assets is transferred on a peer-to-peer basis" and that "the share of illicit transactions appears potentially higher for peer-to-peer transactions." FATF, [_Second 12-Month Review of the Revised FATF Standards on Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers_](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/Second-12-month-review-virtual-assets-vasps.html) (2021.07.05).

### Targeted Updates (2022-2024) <a href="#targeted-updates" id="targeted-updates"></a>

After the two 12-month reviews and the comprehensive October 2021 guidance, the FATF shifted to annual "Targeted Updates" to monitor global implementation. In February 2023, the FATF Plenary also established a roadmap to strengthen implementation, including outreach and assistance to low-capacity jurisdictions. FATF, [_Outcomes FATF Plenary February 2023_](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfgeneral/outcomes-fatf-plenary-february-2023.html) (2023.02).

The **first targeted update** (June 30, 2022) found that of 98 responding jurisdictions, only 29 had passed Travel Rule legislation, and only 11 had begun enforcement. No jurisdiction received a "fully compliant" rating with R.15. The report also addressed emerging risks from DeFi, NFTs, and unhosted wallets. FATF, [_Targeted Update on Implementation of the FATF Standards on Virtual Assets and VASPs_](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/Targeted-update-virtual-assets-vasps.html) (2022.06.30).

The **second targeted update** (June 2023) reported that 75% of jurisdictions were only partially or not compliant with FATF requirements, and more than half of 151 responding jurisdictions had not taken any steps toward implementing the Travel Rule. Notably, 11% of respondents reported opting to prohibit VASPs entirely, up from 7% in 2022. FATF, [_Targeted Update on Implementation of the FATF Standards on Virtual Assets and VASPs_](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/targeted-update-virtual-assets-vasps-2023.html) (2023.06).

The **third targeted update** (June 2024) showed significant improvement: 65 of 94 responding jurisdictions (70%) had passed Travel Rule legislation, though enforcement remained weak, with fewer than one-third (17 of 65) having taken enforcement actions against VASPs for Travel Rule compliance. The prohibition rate continued to rise to 14%. Additionally, 25% of jurisdictions (25 of 130) were rated as "not compliant" with R.15. FATF, [_Targeted Update on Implementation of the FATF Standards on Virtual Assets and VASPs_](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/targeted-update-virtual-assets-vasps-2024.html) (2024.06).

### The Virtual Assets Contact Group <a href="#virtual-assets-contact-group" id="virtual-assets-contact-group"></a>

The FATF established its **Virtual Assets Contact Group (VACG)** in June 2019, operating under the FATF's Policy Development Group, to serve as the hub for promoting implementation of FATF Standards on virtual assets. The VACG engages with the private sector (VASPs, technology providers, technical experts, and academics), conducts outreach to low-capacity jurisdictions, monitors market trends including DeFi and unhosted wallets, and facilitates information-sharing among VASP supervisors. In 2024, the FATF published its first public table showing specific steps taken by individual jurisdictions toward implementing R.15/INR.15. FATF, [_Status of Implementation of Recommendation 15_](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/fatf-gafi/en/publications/Virtualassets/VACG-Snapshot-Jurisdictions.html) (2024).

### Recent Developments (2024-2026) <a href="#recent-developments" id="recent-developments"></a>

In 2024, the FATF published a practical _Quick Guide on Assessing the Money Laundering Risks of Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers_, designed to assist jurisdictions — particularly those with limited experience — in conducting ML risk assessments. The guide provides methodology for risk assessment and identifies relevant data sources, including law enforcement data, government statistics, administrative tax cases, and sector size relative to GDP. The guide emphasizes that countries prohibiting VASPs should still understand ML risks and monitor for unlicensed activity. FATF, [_Quick Guide on Assessing the Money Laundering Risks of Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers_](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Methodsandtrends/quick-guide-on-assessing-ML-risks-of-VA-and-VASPs.html) (2024).

The **sixth targeted update** (June 26, 2025), headlined "FATF urges stronger global action to address Illicit Finance Risks in Virtual Assets," reported that 29% of jurisdictions (40 of 138) were now largely compliant with FATF standards (up from 25% in 2024), while non-compliant jurisdictions decreased to 21%. However, 49% of jurisdictions remained only partially compliant — illustrating that while progress is being made, the majority of the global network still falls short of full implementation.

The update identified stablecoins as the dominant vehicle for on-chain illicit activity, noting that the majority of all on-chain illicit activity was now transacted in stablecoins. It highlighted the ByBit hack by the DPRK ($1.46 billion) as the largest single VA theft in history and cited approximately $51 billion in illicit on-chain activity relating to fraud and scams in 2024. On the Travel Rule specifically, 73% of surveyed jurisdictions (85 of 117, excluding prohibitors) had passed implementing legislation, with 14 more in progress. FATF, [_Targeted Update on Implementation of the FATF Standards on Virtual Assets and VASPs_](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/targeted-update-virtual-assets-vasps-2025.html) (2025.06.26).

Also in June 2025, the FATF published _Best Practices on Travel Rule Supervision_ alongside the sixth targeted update, providing examples of good supervisory practices for jurisdictions developing Travel Rule compliance frameworks. FATF, [_Best Practices on Travel Rule Supervision_](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/dam/fatf-gafi/recommendations/Best-Practices-Travel-Rule-Supervision.pdf) (2025.06).

In November 2025, the FATF issued its first comprehensive _Asset Recovery Guidance and Best Practices_, with substantial treatment of virtual asset recovery. The guidance found that more than 80% of jurisdictions operate at low or moderate levels of effectiveness in asset recovery. For virtual assets specifically, the guidance recommends treating VAs as a distinct asset class throughout the recovery lifecycle — identification, tracing, seizure, valuation, management, and disposal. It further recommends that jurisdictions may need legislative updates to empower authorities to seize, manage, and dispose of VAs, and emphasizes operational awareness for law enforcement: recognizing hardware wallets, seed phrases, and exchange accounts during searches. The guidance promotes public-private partnerships for "real-time crypto crime response." FATF, [_Asset Recovery Guidance and Best Practices_](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Methodsandtrends/asset-recovery-guidance-best-practices-2025.html) (2025.11.04).

The FATF's current work programme includes:

1. **Targeted Paper on Stablecoins** — expected between October 2025 and June 2026;
2. **Targeted Paper on Offshore VASPs** — expected between October 2025 and June 2026;
3. **Targeted Paper/Report on DeFi** — expected between October 2025 and June 2026; and
4. **Seventh Targeted Update** — expected June/July 2026, reporting on jurisdictions' progress in implementing R.15 and regulatory responses to emerging virtual asset risks.

U.S. practitioners should monitor these forthcoming publications, as they will likely inform the next phase of domestic rulemaking and enforcement priorities.

## Country Mutual Evaluations <a href="#country-mutual-evaluations" id="country-mutual-evaluations"></a>

The mutual evaluation process is the enforcement mechanism that gives FATF Recommendations their practical force. Understanding how these evaluations work is essential for U.S. practitioners seeking to anticipate regulatory developments.

Each mutual evaluation involves an on-site visit by a team of assessors drawn from other FATF members, followed by two separate assessments. The **technical compliance** assessment rates each of the 40 Recommendations as Compliant (C), Largely Compliant (LC), Partially Compliant (PC), or Non-Compliant (NC). The **effectiveness** assessment rates 11 "Immediate Outcomes" — measuring whether the country's AML/CFT framework works in practice — as High, Substantial, Moderate, or Low. Countries then receive follow-up reports (FURs) and may be re-rated based on demonstrated progress.

### The U.S. Fourth Round Evaluation (2016) <a href="#us-fourth-round-evaluation" id="us-fourth-round-evaluation"></a>

The FATF adopted its fourth-round mutual evaluation of the United States at the October 2016 Plenary. The evaluation found the U.S. to have a "well-developed and robust" AML/CFT regime with strong national coordination, extensive investigation capabilities, and over 1,200 ML convictions per year. Federal agencies including [FinCEN](https://www.thecod3x.com/fincen/), the FBI, the DEA, and IRS-CI were found to make "good use" of their capabilities. FATF, [_Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Measures — United States — Mutual Evaluation Report_](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Mutualevaluations/Mer-united-states-2016.html) (2016.10).

However, the evaluation also identified "serious gaps" in timely access to beneficial ownership information, minimal AML/CFT coverage of investment advisers, lawyers, accountants, real estate agents, and trust and company service providers (other than trust companies), and a regulatory framework with "significant gaps" in risk mitigation.

Because the 2016 evaluation predated the 2018-2019 FATF amendments on virtual assets, cryptocurrency was not a primary focus of the evaluation methodology at that time. Nevertheless, the U.S. was already regulating virtual currency exchangers as MSBs under FinCEN, and the evaluation acknowledged the existence of this regulatory coverage.

In 2020, the U.S. reported on actions taken to strengthen its AML/CFT framework, and the FATF re-rated the U.S. on Recommendation 10 (Customer Due Diligence) to reflect progress. As of the 2024 follow-up report, the United States is Compliant on 9 of 40 Recommendations, Largely Compliant on 23, Partially Compliant on 5, and Non-Compliant on 3. FATF, [_United States Follow-Up Report_](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/fatf-gafi/en/publications/Mutualevaluations/united-states-fur-2024.html) (2024).

### How Crypto Compliance Factors Into Evaluations <a href="#crypto-in-evaluations" id="crypto-in-evaluations"></a>

Since the 2018-2019 amendments, FATF mutual evaluations now assess five specific dimensions of VA/VASP regulation:

* Whether countries have **identified, assessed, and understood** the ML/TF risks associated with VAs and VASPs (Recommendation 1);
* Whether VASPs are **licensed or registered** and subject to AML/CFT supervision (Recommendation 15);
* Whether the **Travel Rule** is applied to VA transfers (Recommendation 16);
* Whether there is **effective supervision** of VASPs (Immediate Outcome 3); and
* Whether VASPs are filing **suspicious transaction reports** (Immediate Outcome 4).

The FATF has published a public table identifying jurisdictions with "materially important VASP activity" and tracking their R.15 implementation status. FATF, [_Status of Implementation of Recommendation 15_](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/fatf-gafi/en/publications/Virtualassets/VACG-Snapshot-Jurisdictions.html) (2024). For U.S. practitioners, this means that the United States' treatment of virtual asset businesses is now subject to direct FATF scrutiny in the next mutual evaluation round, and any gaps between U.S. regulation and FATF standards — including the $3,000 Travel Rule threshold versus FATF's recommended $1,000 — could result in adverse ratings that carry reputational and practical consequences for U.S. financial institutions operating internationally.

## FATF-Style Regional Bodies <a href="#fatf-style-regional-bodies" id="fatf-style-regional-bodies"></a>

The FATF Global Network extends beyond its 39 members through nine FATF-Style Regional Bodies (FSRBs) that together cover more than 200 jurisdictions. Each FSRB conducts mutual evaluations of its members using the same FATF methodology, including assessment of R.15 compliance for virtual assets.

The nine FSRBs are:

| FSRB         | Full Name                                                                  | Region                  | Members     |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------- |
| **APG**      | Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering                                     | Asia-Pacific            | 41 members  |
| **CFATF**    | Caribbean Financial Action Task Force                                      | Caribbean               | 25+ members |
| **MONEYVAL** | Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of AML Measures and the Financing of Terrorism | Council of Europe | 33 members  |
| **EAG**      | Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism    | Central Asia/Eurasia    | 9 members   |
| **ESAAMLG**  | Eastern and Southern Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group                    | Eastern/Southern Africa | 18 members  |
| **GAFILAT**  | Financial Action Task Force of Latin America                               | Latin America           | 17 members  |
| **GIABA**    | Inter Governmental Action Group against Money Laundering in West Africa    | West Africa             | 17 members  |
| **MENAFATF** | Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force                   | Middle East/North Africa | 21 members |
| **GABAC**    | Task Force on Money Laundering in Central Africa                           | Central Africa          | 11 members  |

Regional developments are relevant to U.S. practitioners because VASP compliance expectations in counterparty jurisdictions are shaped by these bodies. MONEYVAL, the Council of Europe body, has actively scrutinized crypto regulation in its evaluations, particularly in light of the EU's MiCA framework. The APG's region contains some of the world's largest crypto markets — Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Australia — and its evaluations have highlighted both advanced implementation and significant gaps. The CFATF region has seen crypto innovation in jurisdictions like the Bahamas and Bermuda alongside enforcement challenges, with several Caribbean jurisdictions grey-listed partly due to VA/VASP compliance gaps.

A U.S. exchange transacting with a VASP in an FSRB member jurisdiction must assess whether that counterparty's regulatory environment meets FATF standards. An FSRB evaluation finding significant deficiencies in R.15 compliance may be a red flag for correspondent risk purposes.

Per the FATF's June 2025 targeted update, across the entire Global Network, only 29% of jurisdictions (40 of 138) are largely compliant with VA/VASP standards, 49% are partially compliant, 21% are not compliant, and 20% have opted to prohibit VASPs entirely. These figures underscore the significance of counterparty jurisdiction risk assessment for U.S. practitioners.

## Influence on U.S. Policy <a href="#influence-on-us-policy" id="influence-on-us-policy"></a>

### Relationship to FinCEN Guidance <a href="#relationship-to-fincen-guidance" id="relationship-to-fincen-guidance"></a>

FATF standards have significantly shaped U.S. regulatory approaches to cryptocurrency. [FinCEN](https://www.thecod3x.com/fincen/) classified virtual currency exchangers and administrators as money services businesses in its March 2013 guidance (FIN-2013-G001), preceding but aligning with the direction the FATF was moving. In May 2019 — one month before the FATF adopted INR.15 — FinCEN issued updated guidance (FIN-2019-G001) consolidating its regulations on virtual currency money transmission, explicitly noting that the U.S. framework was consistent with emerging international standards. FinCEN, [_Application of FinCEN's Regulations to Certain Business Models Involving Convertible Virtual Currencies_](https://www.fincen.gov/resources/statutes-regulations/guidance/application-fincens-regulations-certain-business-models) (2019.05.09).

FinCEN's December 2020 proposed rulemaking to lower the crypto Travel Rule threshold to $250 for international transfers and implement currency transaction reports for VA transactions above $10,000 was explicitly informed by FATF standards and the concern that the U.S. $3,000 threshold exceeded FATF's recommended $1,000. These proposals remain unfinalized as of February 2026.

The [Treasury](https://www.thecod3x.com/treasury/) Department's 2022 _Action Plan to Address Illicit Financing Risks of Digital Assets_ explicitly referenced FATF standards as its framework and committed the U.S. to working through FATF to promote global implementation of VA/VASP standards.

More broadly, FATF evaluations and pressure have contributed to:

* FinCEN's consistent treatment of crypto exchanges as MSBs;
* the application of BSA Travel Rule requirements to crypto transactions;
* OCC and banking agency guidance on crypto-related activities;
* U.S. support for global Travel Rule implementation;
* [OFAC](https://www.thecod3x.com/ofac/) enforcement actions against virtual asset platforms facilitating sanctions evasion; and
* congressional interest in beneficial ownership legislation (the Corporate Transparency Act, enacted in 2021, effective 2024).

In each case, the FATF's standard-setting function provides the international architecture that U.S. regulators then implement through domestic law. The relationship is not one of direct transposition — the U.S. adapts FATF standards to fit its existing regulatory framework — but the directional influence is consistent and significant.

### Terminological Differences (VA vs. CVC, VASP vs. MSB) <a href="#terminological-differences" id="terminological-differences"></a>

U.S. practitioners must navigate important terminological differences between FATF and U.S. domestic frameworks:

| Concept                    | FATF Terminology                      | U.S. (FinCEN) Terminology                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Digital currency           | Virtual Asset (VA)                    | Convertible Virtual Currency (CVC)                    |
| Intermediary               | Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) | Money Services Business (MSB) / Money Transmitter     |
| Information-sharing rule   | Travel Rule (Recommendation 16)       | BSA Travel Rule / Funds Travel Rule                   |
| Threshold                  | USD/EUR 1,000                         | $3,000 (BSA Travel Rule)                              |

These differences are not merely semantic. The FATF's VASP definition encompasses five specific activities; FinCEN's MSB framework uses different categories (money transmitter, exchanger, administrator) that do not map one-to-one to FATF's VASP activities. For example, FATF activity (iv) (custody/safekeeping) and activity (v) (participation in token issuance) have no precise FinCEN MSB analog, though FinCEN has addressed custodial wallet providers through its money transmitter guidance. The FATF's VA definition is arguably broader than FinCEN's CVC concept — "virtual asset" encompasses any digital representation of value used for payment or investment purposes, while "convertible virtual currency" is limited to mediums of exchange that function as a substitute for real currency.

The threshold discrepancy is particularly consequential. U.S. VASPs operating internationally may face stricter Travel Rule obligations under foreign law than under domestic BSA requirements. A U.S.-based exchange sending a $1,500 transfer to an EU-based VASP owes no Travel Rule information under U.S. law (the $3,000 threshold is not met) but must comply with the EU's zero-threshold requirement, effectively creating a compliance obligation driven by the counterparty's jurisdiction rather than the originator's.

Understanding these terminological and structural differences is essential for U.S. practitioners advising clients with international operations, as the FATF framework — not the U.S. framework — often represents the more demanding compliance baseline.
