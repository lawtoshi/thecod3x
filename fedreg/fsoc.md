# 1.25 - Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC)

## Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

The Financial Stability Oversight Council ("FSOC" or the "Council") is not a traditional regulatory agency. It does not write rules for market participants, conduct examinations, or bring enforcement actions. Instead, FSOC functions as the federal government's systemic risk coordinator -- a deliberative body that identifies emerging threats to financial stability, facilitates information sharing among its member agencies, and, when necessary, recommends that those agencies take action within their respective jurisdictions. This distinction is critical for understanding FSOC's role in digital asset policy: the Council shapes the conversation and sets the agenda, but the actual regulatory work is carried out by its member agencies -- the [SEC](https://www.thecod3x.com/sec/), [CFTC](https://www.thecod3x.com/cftc/), [FDIC](https://www.thecod3x.com/fdic/), [OCC](https://www.thecod3x.com/occ/), [the Fed](https://www.thecod3x.com/thefed/), and others.

Congress created FSOC in Title I of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 in direct response to the 2008 financial crisis, which had revealed dangerous blind spots in a regulatory architecture where no single entity was responsible for monitoring system-wide risk. _See_ [12 U.S.C. § 5321](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/5321). FSOC is chaired by the Secretary of the [Treasury](https://www.thecod3x.com/treasury/) and comprises the heads of every major federal financial regulator, giving it a panoramic view of the financial system that no individual agency possesses. Its principal outputs are annual reports assessing financial stability risks, special reports on emerging issues, and formal recommendations to primary regulators under Section 120 of Dodd-Frank. It also holds the power to designate nonbank financial companies as systemically important financial institutions ("SIFIs"), subjecting them to enhanced Federal Reserve supervision. The Council is supported by the Office of Financial Research ("OFR"), which Congress created in the same title of Dodd-Frank ([12 U.S.C. § 5341](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/5341)) to provide data and analytical support.

For digital asset practitioners, FSOC's importance lies not in direct regulatory action -- the Council has never issued a rule, brought an enforcement case, or designated a crypto firm -- but in its agenda-setting power. When FSOC classifies something as a financial stability "vulnerability" in its annual report, it sends a signal to every member agency that the issue demands attention. Conversely, when FSOC removes that classification, as it did in 2025, it signals that the regulatory posture should shift. Understanding FSOC is thus essential to understanding the trajectory of federal digital asset policy.

FSOC's engagement with digital assets traces a remarkable arc -- arguably the most dramatic policy reversal in the Council's fifteen-year history. The Council first substantively addressed crypto-assets and stablecoins in its December 2021 Annual Report. By December 2022 -- in the wake of the TerraUSD and FTX collapses -- FSOC had classified digital assets as a financial stability "vulnerability," a designation it maintained through the 2023 and 2024 annual reports while issuing increasingly urgent calls for stablecoin legislation. The 2024 Annual Report, the last under the Biden administration, contained the strongest language yet, warning that stablecoins were "acutely vulnerable to runs." Then, on December 11, 2025, the Council's annual report under Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent removed digital assets from the vulnerability list entirely and reframed stablecoins as instruments that could strengthen the dollar's international role. This reversal -- from systemic threat to strategic asset in the span of three years -- reflects the broader realignment of federal crypto policy under the Trump administration.

## Statutory Framework <a href="#statutory-framework" id="statutory-framework"></a>

### Establishment and Membership <a href="#establishment-and-membership" id="establishment-and-membership"></a>

FSOC was established by Section 111 of the Dodd-Frank Act, codified at [12 U.S.C. § 5321](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/5321). The Act was signed into law on July 21, 2010. Section 112 sets forth three core statutory purposes:

1. **Identify risks** to the financial stability of the United States that could arise from the material financial distress or failure, or ongoing activities, of large, interconnected bank holding companies or nonbank financial companies, or that could arise outside the financial services marketplace;
2. **Promote market discipline** by eliminating expectations on the part of shareholders, creditors, and counterparties that the government will shield them from losses in the event of failure; and
3. **Respond to emerging threats** to the stability of the United States financial system.

_See_ [12 U.S.C. § 5322](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/5322).

The Council has fifteen members -- ten voting and five nonvoting. The ten voting members are:

1. Secretary of the Treasury (Chairperson)
2. Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
3. Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)
4. Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)
5. Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
6. Chairperson of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)
7. Chairperson of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)
8. Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)
9. Chairman of the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA)
10. An independent member with insurance expertise, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate

The five nonvoting members are the Director of the Office of Financial Research, the Director of the Federal Insurance Office, and one representative each designated by state insurance commissioners, state banking supervisors, and state securities commissioners. _See_ [12 U.S.C. § 5321](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/5321).

### Key Authorities (SIFI Designation, FMU Designation, Section 120 Recommendations) <a href="#key-authorities" id="key-authorities"></a>

FSOC's most consequential powers include:

**Nonbank SIFI Designation (Section 113).** FSOC may designate nonbank financial companies as "systemically important financial institutions" under [12 U.S.C. § 5323](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/5323), subjecting them to consolidated Federal Reserve supervision and enhanced prudential standards including heightened capital, liquidity, and risk management requirements.

**Financial Market Utility and PCS Designation (Title VIII).** Under Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Council may designate financial market utilities ("FMUs") or payment, clearing, and settlement ("PCS") activities as systemically important. Eight FMUs have been designated (e.g., DTCC, CME, ICE Clear Credit), but none are crypto-related, and the PCS activities designation authority has never been exercised.

**Recommendations to Primary Regulators (Section 120).** Under [12 U.S.C. § 5330](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/5330), FSOC may issue formal recommendations to primary financial regulatory agencies regarding new or heightened standards or safeguards for activities or practices within their jurisdictions.

**Annual Reports (Section 112(a)(2)(N)).** FSOC must publish an annual report describing its activities and assessing significant financial market and regulatory developments. This mandate has become the Council's primary vehicle for addressing digital assets, and the progression of these reports from 2021 through 2025 constitutes the central narrative of FSOC's crypto engagement.

**Information Collection.** FSOC may collect and evaluate financial data from member agencies to monitor systemic risk. This authority is supported by the Office of Financial Research, which provides the Council with data aggregation and analytical capabilities that individual agencies may lack.

It bears emphasis that FSOC does not itself have rulemaking or enforcement authority over market participants. When the Council identifies a risk and issues a recommendation, it is the relevant member agency -- not FSOC -- that must act. This structural feature explains both FSOC's influence (it coordinates the entire federal regulatory apparatus) and its limitations (it cannot compel action and must rely on its members' willingness to implement its recommendations).

## Digital Assets in Annual Reports <a href="#digital-assets-in-annual-reports" id="digital-assets-in-annual-reports"></a>

The progression of FSOC's annual reports from 2021 through 2025 provides the clearest documentary record of how the federal government's systemic risk assessment of digital assets evolved -- and ultimately reversed -- over a five-year period. Each annual report reflects the unanimous assessment of the Council's ten voting members, making these documents especially significant as statements of coordinated federal policy.

### 2021 Annual Report <a href="#2021-annual-report" id="2021-annual-report"></a>

FSOC's 2021 Annual Report, released on December 17, 2021, marked the first time the Council substantively addressed digital assets and stablecoins as a distinct financial stability concern. FSOC, [_2021 Annual Report_](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-markets-financial-institutions-and-fiscal-service/financial-stability-oversight-council/studies-and-reports/annual-reports/fsoc-2021-annual-report) (2021.12.17). The report recommended that federal and state regulators "continue to examine risks to the financial system posed by new and emerging uses of digital assets" and coordinate to address potential issues. It also endorsed the recommendations in the President's Working Group on Financial Markets ("PWG") _Report on Stablecoins_, which had been published on November 1, 2021, and urged member agencies to "consider the recommendations" contained therein. The Council stated it would "further assess and monitor the potential risks of stablecoins" while recommending that members "consider appropriate actions within each member's jurisdiction to address those risks." _See_ [Treasury Press Release jy0541](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0541) (2021.12.17).

### 2022 Annual Report (Crypto as "Vulnerability") <a href="#2022-annual-report" id="2022-annual-report"></a>

The 2022 Annual Report, released on December 16, 2022, represented a significant escalation. For the first time, FSOC classified digital assets as a "vulnerability" within the report's financial stability taxonomy -- a formal designation reserved for conditions that the Council views as capable of amplifying shocks to the financial system. _See_ [Treasury Press Release jy1171](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1171) (2022.12.16); Buckley LLP, [_FSOC Annual Report Highlights Digital Asset, Cybersecurity, and Climate Risks_](https://buckleyfirm.com/blog/2022-12-21/fsoc-annual-report-highlights-digital-asset-cybersecurity-and-climate-risks) (2022.12.21).

The timing was not coincidental. The report was issued in the wake of two events that had shaken confidence in the digital asset ecosystem: the TerraUSD/LUNA algorithmic stablecoin collapse in May 2022, which erased approximately $40 billion in value, and the FTX bankruptcy in November 2022, which exposed the misappropriation of billions in customer funds. The report also emphasized the importance of agencies continuing to enforce existing rules applicable to the crypto-asset ecosystem -- a point that the [SEC](https://www.thecod3x.com/sec/) under Chair Gensler had already been acting on aggressively.

The Council issued four specific recommendations regarding digital assets:

1. **Spot Market Legislation:** Congress should enact legislation providing rulemaking authority for federal financial regulators over the spot market for crypto-assets that are not securities, including enforcement and examination authority.
2. **Regulatory Arbitrage:** Steps should be taken to address regulatory arbitrage, including through stablecoin legislation, visibility into affiliates and subsidiaries of crypto-asset entities, and service provider regulation.
3. **Vertically Integrated Platforms:** Regulators should assess whether vertically integrated crypto platforms -- which combine brokerage, exchange, clearing, and custody within a single entity -- can or should be accommodated under existing laws.
4. **Regulatory Capacity:** Council members should continue building supervisory and analytical capacity related to digital asset activities.

### 2023 Annual Report <a href="#2023-annual-report" id="2023-annual-report"></a>

The 2023 Annual Report, released on December 14, 2023, maintained digital assets on the vulnerability list despite the fact that the Spring 2023 crypto market turmoil and associated bank failures had not produced broader contagion in the traditional financial system. The Council acknowledged that "digital asset markets and their connections to the traditional financial system continue to be not significant," but warned that vulnerabilities persisted and could grow as interconnections between crypto and traditional finance increased. _See_ [Treasury Press Release jy1991](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1991) (2023.12.14); Debevoise & Plimpton, [_FSOC's 2023 Annual Report and Recent Revisions_](https://www.debevoise.com/-/media/files/insights/publications/2023/12/fsocs-2023-annual-report-and-recent-revisions.pdf) (2023.12). The report identified specific areas of concern:

* Crypto-asset price volatility and high leverage
* Interconnectedness within the crypto industry
* Operational risks
* Risk of runs on crypto-asset platforms and stablecoins
* Token ownership concentration
* Cybersecurity risks
* Proliferation of platforms acting outside of or out of compliance with applicable laws
* Vertically integrated entities combining lending, investing, and market-making within a single firm, creating conflicts of interest

The Council reiterated its recommendation that Congress pass legislation to regulate both stablecoins and the spot market for crypto-assets that are not securities. The report also noted that FSOC's Digital Asset Working Group continued to serve as a forum for member agencies to facilitate information sharing about market developments and analysis related to digital assets. Notably, the 2023 report was issued just weeks after FSOC finalized its revised nonbank SIFI designation guidance on November 3, 2023, raising the question of whether the lowered barriers to designation might be applied to crypto firms -- a question the Council left unanswered.

### 2024 Annual Report (Strongest Stablecoin Warnings) <a href="#2024-annual-report" id="2024-annual-report"></a>

The 2024 Annual Report, released on December 6, 2024, contained the strongest language on stablecoin risk in FSOC's history. The Council warned that stablecoins "continue to represent a potential risk to financial stability because they are acutely vulnerable to runs absent appropriate risk management standards." The report highlighted severe market concentration, noting that a single firm accounted for approximately 70% of total stablecoin market value, and described the resulting run risk as "amplified by issues related to both market concentration and market opacity." _See_ FSOC, [_2024 Annual Report_](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/FSOC2024AnnualReport.pdf) (2024.12.06); [Treasury Press Release jy2738](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2738) (2024.12.06).

The report also noted that "although a few stablecoins are subject to state-level supervision requiring regular reporting, many provide limited verifiable information about their holdings and reserve management practices." The absence of mandatory disclosure requirements meant that market participants had to rely on voluntary attestations from stablecoin issuers -- attestations that the Council viewed as insufficient to support informed risk assessment.

Beyond stablecoins, the 2024 report cited more than $5.6 billion in crypto-related fraud losses in 2023, flagged the increasing use of stablecoins by terrorist groups, and warned that investor losses could "undermine confidence in financial regulation more broadly." It reiterated once more its recommendation that Congress create "a comprehensive federal prudential framework for stablecoin issuers." This was the final annual report under the Biden administration, and it represented the culmination of four years of escalating concern -- a posture that would be comprehensively reversed within twelve months.

### 2025 Annual Report (Digital Assets Removed from Vulnerability List) <a href="#2025-annual-report" id="2025-annual-report"></a>

On December 11, 2025, the Council released an annual report that marked a paradigm shift in federal digital asset policy. Under the chairmanship of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, digital assets were removed from the list of financial stability vulnerabilities entirely -- ending a three-year period (2022-2024) in which crypto had been formally flagged as a systemic concern. The word "vulnerabilities" was itself removed from the report's table of contents; Secretary Bessent's opening letter acknowledged the philosophical departure from the danger-focused framing that had characterized prior reports. _See_ FSOC, [_2025 Annual Report_](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/FSOC2025AnnualReport.pdf) (2025.12.11); [Treasury Press Release sb0334](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0334) (2025.12.11); CoinDesk, [_U.S. Financial Risk Watchdog FSOC Erased Digital Assets as a Potential Hazard Area_](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/12/11/u-s-financial-risk-watchdog-fsoc-erased-digital-assets-as-a-potential-hazard-area) (2025.12.11).

In place of warning language, the 2025 report detailed how U.S. financial regulators had "withdrew their previous policy stance in which they generally cautioned regulated financial firms with the risks of getting involved in the industry and sometimes stood in the way." The report praised the passage of the GENIUS Act and the rescission of banking agency crypto-cautionary statements (including the January 2023 and February 2023 joint statements by the Fed, FDIC, and OCC). While noting in an "illicit finance" subsection that stablecoins may be "abused to facilitate illicit finance transactions," the report also stated that "continued use of U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins is expected to support the role of the U.S. dollar in the international financial system over the next decade."

The report adopted four new priority areas -- Treasury markets, cybersecurity, regulatory modernization, and AI -- replacing the vulnerability-focused framework of prior years.

The significance of the 2025 report cannot be overstated. In the span of a single year, digital assets moved from being classified alongside cybersecurity threats and climate-related financial risks as a systemic vulnerability to being presented as a source of innovation and dollar hegemony. The 2025 report represents the most dramatic single-year reversal in FSOC's institutional posture since its creation, and it provides the clearest evidence that the federal government's crypto policy has shifted from a posture of caution to one of accommodation.

## Report on Digital Asset Financial Stability Risks (October 2022) <a href="#report-on-digital-asset-financial-stability-risks" id="report-on-digital-asset-financial-stability-risks"></a>

### EO 14067 Mandate <a href="#eo-14067-mandate" id="eo-14067-mandate"></a>

On March 9, 2022, President Biden signed Executive Order 14067, "Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets," which directed the Secretary of the Treasury to convene FSOC to produce a report identifying digital asset financial stability risks and regulatory gaps. Section 6 of the Executive Order specifically mandated that the report address "the extent to which digital assets create systemic risk" and "the adequacy of protections afforded to participants in digital asset markets." On October 3, 2022, the Council released the resulting report: the _Report on Digital Asset Financial Stability Risks and Regulation_, a document spanning over 100 pages that drew on input from all FSOC member agencies. _See_ FSOC, [_Report on Digital Asset Financial Stability Risks and Regulation_](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/FSOC-Digital-Assets-Report-2022.pdf) (2022.10.03); [Treasury Press Release jy0986](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0986) (2022.10.03); _see also_ FSOC, [_Fact Sheet_](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/Fact-Sheet-Report-on-Digital-Asset-Financial-Stability-Risks-and-Regulation.pdf) (2022.10.03).

The report represented the most comprehensive federal assessment of crypto-asset systemic risk to date. It defined "digital assets" as encompassing both central bank digital currencies and crypto-assets, but focused primarily on crypto-assets. EO 14067 was subsequently revoked by President Trump on January 23, 2025.

### Regulatory Gaps Identified (Spot Market, Arbitrage, Vertical Integration) <a href="#regulatory-gaps-identified" id="regulatory-gaps-identified"></a>

The report identified three principal gaps in the existing regulatory framework:

**Limited spot market oversight.** Federal regulation did not apply to the spot market for crypto-assets that are not securities, even when trading platforms engaged in activities -- such as custodial services -- that would be regulated in other markets. The report noted that the [CFTC](https://www.thecod3x.com/cftc/) already had broad authority over derivative transactions in non-security crypto-assets but not over spot markets. This gap meant that Bitcoin and other tokens classified as commodities rather than securities could be traded on platforms with no federal registration, reporting, or consumer asset segregation requirements.

**Regulatory arbitrage.** Crypto-asset entities offered services similar to those of traditional financial institutions but lacked a consistent or comprehensive regulatory framework, enabling them to select the lightest regulatory regime. The absence of a uniform federal standard meant that entities could structure their operations to minimize oversight -- incorporating in jurisdictions with minimal requirements while serving U.S. customers, or characterizing their tokens in ways designed to avoid securities classification.

**Vertically integrated market structures.** Some crypto-asset trading platforms combined brokerage, exchange, clearing, and custody functions -- services that are typically separated in traditional finance to manage conflicts of interest and reduce systemic risk. The report warned that retail investors faced particular vulnerability from practices such as automated liquidation on these platforms. The FTX collapse in November 2022 had illustrated these risks vividly: a single entity controlled trading, custody, lending, and proprietary trading functions, enabling the misappropriation of customer assets.

The report also identified stablecoins and crypto-asset lending platforms as an "important emerging vulnerability" and included a dedicated analysis (designated "Box C") of the May 2022 TerraUSD algorithmic stablecoin collapse and its contagion effects across the crypto ecosystem. The report concluded that digital assets did not at that time pose a great risk to the U.S. financial system but "could pose risks if their interconnectedness with the traditional financial system or overall scale grows substantially, unaccompanied by appropriate regulation." _See_ Davis Polk, [_FSOC Report on Digital Asset Financial Stability Risks: Key Takeaways_](https://www.davispolk.com/insights/client-update/fsoc-report-digital-asset-financial-stability-risks-and-regulation-key) (2022.10).

### Recommendations to Congress <a href="#recommendations-to-congress" id="recommendations-to-congress"></a>

The Council issued six recommendations:

1. Congress should pass legislation providing rulemaking authority for federal financial regulators over the spot market for non-security crypto-assets, including authority over trading practices, recordkeeping, reporting, consumer asset segregation, cybersecurity, and investor protection.
2. Congress should enact stablecoin legislation consistent with the PWG Stablecoin Report.
3. Legislation should provide regulators with authority to supervise affiliates and subsidiaries of crypto-asset entities.
4. Service providers to the crypto-asset ecosystem should be subject to appropriate regulation.
5. Council members should continue to build analytical, supervisory, and data capabilities.
6. Agencies should continue enforcing existing rules applicable to the crypto-asset ecosystem.

The report did not recommend which specific federal agency should receive spot market authority, though it acknowledged the [CFTC](https://www.thecod3x.com/cftc/)'s existing derivatives jurisdiction over non-security crypto-assets. This deliberate ambiguity reflected an unresolved interagency tension: the [SEC](https://www.thecod3x.com/sec/) under Chair Gensler took the position that most crypto tokens were already securities subject to existing SEC authority, while the [CFTC](https://www.thecod3x.com/cftc/) sought legislative expansion of its jurisdiction over spot commodity markets. The question of which agency should have primary jurisdiction over non-security crypto-assets would remain unresolved until the CLARITY Act began moving through Congress in 2025.

At the time of the report's release, then-SEC Chair Gary Gensler issued a statement emphasizing that many crypto tokens already meet the definition of securities under existing law and that the [SEC](https://www.thecod3x.com/sec/) has existing enforcement authority. Then-Acting Comptroller Michael Hsu issued a statement supporting the report's recommendations for legislation to address regulatory gaps. _See_ SEC, [_Statement by Chair Gensler_](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-fsoc-meeting-100322) (2022.10.03); OCC, [_News Release nr-occ-2022-123_](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2022/nr-occ-2022-123.html) (2022.10.03).

## Stablecoin Risk Analysis <a href="#stablecoin-risk-analysis" id="stablecoin-risk-analysis"></a>

### PWG Stablecoin Report Endorsement (November 2021) <a href="#pwg-stablecoin-report" id="pwg-stablecoin-report"></a>

On November 1, 2021, the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, joined by the [FDIC](https://www.thecod3x.com/fdic/) and the [OCC](https://www.thecod3x.com/occ/), published the _Report on Stablecoins_. _See_ PWG, FDIC, & OCC, [_Report on Stablecoins_](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0454) (2021.11.01). The report's key recommendations included: (1) stablecoin issuers should be required to be insured depository institutions, subject to supervision at the depository and holding company levels; (2) custodial wallet providers should be subject to federal oversight, including restrictions on lending and compliance obligations for risk management, liquidity, and capital; (3) stablecoin issuers should comply with activities restrictions limiting affiliation with commercial entities; and (4) FSOC should consider designating certain stablecoin activities as systemically important PCS activities under Title VIII of Dodd-Frank.

The fourth recommendation was particularly significant because it identified a pathway for FSOC to impose direct oversight on stablecoin arrangements without new legislation from Congress -- a mechanism that would have bypassed the lengthy legislative process. FSOC endorsed the PWG report's recommendations in its December 2021 Annual Report, but as discussed below, the Council never exercised its PCS designation authority over any stablecoin arrangement. For additional analysis of the PWG Stablecoin Report and its implications for insured depository institutions, _see_ the [FDIC](https://www.thecod3x.com/fdic/) and [OCC](https://www.thecod3x.com/occ/) sections of this treatise.

### FSOC's Escalating Concerns (2022-2024) <a href="#fsocs-escalating-concerns" id="fsocs-escalating-concerns"></a>

Between 2022 and 2024, FSOC's language regarding stablecoin risk escalated with each successive annual report, reflecting both worsening market conditions and growing frustration with congressional inaction:

* **October 2022 Special Report:** Identified stablecoins as an "important emerging vulnerability" and analyzed the TerraUSD collapse.
* **2022 Annual Report:** Recommended stablecoin legislation for the first time.
* **2023 Annual Report:** Reiterated the stablecoin legislation recommendation and noted that stablecoin run risk persisted.
* **2024 Annual Report:** Reached the apex of concern, declaring stablecoins "acutely vulnerable to runs," warning of a single issuer controlling approximately 70% of stablecoin market capitalization, and citing the use of stablecoins for terrorist financing.

_See_ FSOC, [_2024 Annual Report_](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/FSOC2024AnnualReport.pdf) (2024.12.06).

Despite this escalating rhetoric, FSOC never exercised its Title VIII PCS designation authority over stablecoin arrangements or any other crypto-related activity. Nor did FSOC adopt any rules or guidance concerning the processes or standards applicable to PCS designation. The Council's approach throughout 2021-2024 was to call for congressional legislation rather than exercise its existing statutory powers -- a pattern that some commentators viewed as reflecting political reluctance to act unilaterally and others viewed as an appropriate deference to Congress on novel policy questions.

### GENIUS Act Resolution (July 2025) <a href="#genius-act-resolution" id="genius-act-resolution"></a>

The legislative response to FSOC's years of stablecoin warnings culminated in the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (the "GENIUS Act"), which President Trump signed into law on July 18, 2025, following bipartisan passage in the Senate (68-30 on June 17, 2025) and the House (308-122 on July 17, 2025). _See_ [S.394](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/394/text); [White House Fact Sheet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/07/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-signs-genius-act-into-law/) (2025.07.18).

Key provisions of the GENIUS Act include:

* Creates a category of "permitted payment stablecoin issuers"
* Requires one-to-one backing by U.S. dollars or other low-risk assets (the first federal requirement of its kind)
* Distributes primary oversight among [the Fed](https://www.thecod3x.com/thefed/), [OCC](https://www.thecod3x.com/occ/), [FDIC](https://www.thecod3x.com/fdic/), and state regulators depending on issuer type
* Insured depository institutions and credit union subsidiaries are regulated by their primary financial regulator; federally licensed nonbank stablecoin issuers are subject to [OCC](https://www.thecod3x.com/occ/) oversight
* Payment stablecoins are expressly excluded from classification as securities or commodities, exempting them from [SEC](https://www.thecod3x.com/sec/) and [CFTC](https://www.thecod3x.com/cftc/) jurisdiction
* FSOC is assigned a monitoring and reporting role, required to incorporate stablecoin stability findings into its annual reports under Section 112(a)(2)(N) of Dodd-Frank
* Effective date: the earlier of 18 months after enactment or 120 days after agencies issue final implementing regulations

_See_ Latham & Watkins, [_The GENIUS Act of 2025: Stablecoin Legislation Adopted in the U.S._](https://www.lw.com/en/insights/the-genius-act-of-2025-stablecoin-legislation-adopted-in-the-us) (2025.07); Covington, [_The GENIUS Act Becomes Law: Key Provisions_](https://www.cov.com/news-and-insights/insights/2025/07/the-genius-act-becomes-law-key-provisions-from-the-federal-stablecoin-regulatory-framework) (2025.07). The GENIUS Act effectively resolved the stablecoin question that FSOC had flagged in every annual report since 2021, providing the "comprehensive federal prudential framework" the Council had repeatedly called for -- albeit through a legislative architecture that differs materially from the insured-depository-institution model that the PWG had originally recommended in 2021. For additional analysis of the GENIUS Act's regulatory framework, _see_ the [Treasury](https://www.thecod3x.com/treasury/) and [OCC](https://www.thecod3x.com/occ/) sections of this treatise.

## 2023 Bank Failures and FSOC Response <a href="#2023-bank-failures" id="2023-bank-failures"></a>

### Systemic Risk Exception (March 12, 2023) <a href="#systemic-risk-exception" id="systemic-risk-exception"></a>

In March 2023, a series of bank failures tested FSOC's role as systemic risk coordinator and underscored the crypto industry's dependence on a small number of banking relationships. The timeline was rapid:

* **Silvergate Bank** announced a voluntary wind-down on **March 8, 2023**. Silvergate was a primary banking partner for crypto companies through its Silvergate Exchange Network ("SEN"), a 24/7 real-time payment platform for commercial crypto clients.
* **Silicon Valley Bank ("SVB")**, with $209 billion in assets, was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation on **March 10, 2023**. SVB had significant exposure to crypto startups and venture capital firms in the sector.
* **Signature Bank**, with $110 billion in assets at year-end 2022, was closed by the New York State Department of Financial Services on **March 12, 2023**. Signature was the other primary banking partner for crypto companies through its Signet real-time payment platform.

On March 12, 2023, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, upon recommendation of the FDIC Board of Directors and with the written concurrence of the Federal Reserve Board, invoked the systemic risk exception under Section 13(c)(4)(G) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act in two separate actions -- one for SVB and one for Signature Bank -- enabling the [FDIC](https://www.thecod3x.com/fdic/) to fully protect all depositors, including uninsured depositors. _See_ [Joint Statement by Treasury, Federal Reserve, and FDIC](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230312b.htm) (2023.03.12). The FDIC estimated the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund at $16.1 billion for SVB and $2.4 billion for Signature Bank, of which approximately $15.8 billion was attributable to covering uninsured deposits. On November 29, 2023, the FDIC published a Federal Register notice for a Special Assessment to recover these costs. _See_ [88 Fed. Reg. 82967](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/11/29/2023-25813/special-assessment-pursuant-to-systemic-risk-determination) (2023.11.29).

It is important to distinguish this emergency action from FSOC's Section 113 SIFI designation power. The systemic risk exception is an emergency resolution mechanism under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, invoked by the Treasury Secretary with FDIC and Fed concurrence to authorize extraordinary resolution actions for a failing bank. It is not an FSOC designation proceeding, and it does not involve FSOC voting or formal Council action. FSOC as a body played a coordinating role during the March 2023 crisis -- facilitating communication among its member agencies and assessing the systemic implications of the failures -- but the formal legal authority to invoke the systemic risk exception rested with the Treasury Secretary acting in her capacity as head of [Treasury](https://www.thecod3x.com/treasury/), not as FSOC Chair.

### Crypto Industry Connections (SEN and Signet Platforms) <a href="#crypto-industry-connections" id="crypto-industry-connections"></a>

The 2023 bank failures were driven primarily by interest rate risk and deposit concentration rather than crypto-asset losses directly. SVB's failure resulted from unrealized losses on its long-duration bond portfolio and a classic depositor run; Signature Bank faced similar dynamics with concentrated, credit-sensitive depositor bases. The important exception was Silvergate, whose difficulties were directly attributable to losses from the FTX/Alameda collapse in November 2022 and the subsequent crypto-industry deposit outflows that followed. _See_ GAO, [_2023 Bank Failure Systemic Risk Report_](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-25-107023) (2025).

The loss of Silvergate, SVB, and Signature Bank eliminated the three institutions most willing to serve U.S. crypto companies. The SEN and Signet platforms had been considered core infrastructure for institutional crypto settlement, enabling 24/7 real-time dollar transfers that traditional banking rails could not match. Their disappearance contributed to what industry participants described as the "de-banking" of the U.S. crypto industry, as surviving banks became reluctant to accept crypto companies as clients -- a dynamic that would later be cited by the Trump administration as evidence that the prior regulatory posture had been excessively restrictive. For additional analysis of the March 2023 bank failures and the systemic risk exception, _see_ the [FDIC](https://www.thecod3x.com/fdic/) section of this treatise.

FSOC's 2023 Annual Report addressed the bank failures primarily through the lens of banking system resilience rather than crypto risk, characterizing the system as "resilient overall, despite the Spring 2023 turmoil." The report recommended that banking agencies monitor uninsured deposit levels, depositor composition, and banks' reliance on uninsured or credit-sensitive deposits, and it highlighted interest rate risk, business concentrations, and overreliance on uninsured deposits as key lessons learned. _See_ [Treasury Press Release jy1991](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1991) (2023.12.14). The Council did not directly attribute the failures to crypto but maintained digital assets as a vulnerability category.

## SIFI Designation Authority and Crypto <a href="#sifi-designation-authority" id="sifi-designation-authority"></a>

### Prior Nonbank Designations <a href="#prior-nonbank-designations" id="prior-nonbank-designations"></a>

Under Section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act ([12 U.S.C. § 5323](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/5323)), FSOC may determine that a nonbank financial company's material financial distress, or the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix of its activities, could pose a threat to U.S. financial stability. Designated companies become subject to consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve and enhanced prudential standards covering capital, liquidity, risk management, and related matters.

Between 2013 and 2014, FSOC designated four nonbank financial companies as SIFIs:

1. **American International Group, Inc. (AIG)** -- designated July 2013; rescinded September 2017
2. **General Electric Capital Corporation (GECC)** -- designated July 2013; rescinded June 2016
3. **Prudential Financial, Inc.** -- designated September 2013; rescinded October 2018
4. **MetLife, Inc.** -- designated December 2014; successfully challenged in federal court

MetLife's successful challenge is particularly noteworthy. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia vacated the designation, finding that FSOC had departed from its own guidance and failed to adequately consider the costs of designation. _See_ _MetLife, Inc. v. FSOC_, 177 F. Supp. 3d 219 (D.D.C. 2016). FSOC rescinded the designation in January 2018 rather than pursue an appeal. By that point, all four nonbank SIFI designations had been unwound, and no new designations have been made since.

On November 3, 2023, FSOC's ten voting members unanimously finalized two documents: a revised Analytic Framework for Financial Stability Risks and updated Interpretive Guidance on Nonbank SIFI Designations. _See_ [Treasury Press Release jy1876](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1876) (2023.11.03). The 2023 guidance replaced the 2019 framework and lowered barriers to designation in three significant respects:

* **Eliminated the "activities-based approach first" requirement.** Under the 2019 guidance, FSOC had to attempt to have existing regulators address identified risks through regulation before designating a specific entity. The 2023 guidance removed this prerequisite, allowing FSOC to proceed directly to entity-specific designation.
* **Removed the cost-benefit analysis requirement.** FSOC no longer had to conduct a cost-benefit analysis before designating a company -- a change that responded to the MetLife court's criticism of FSOC's prior analytical approach.
* **Permitted designation based on activities.** FSOC could now designate based on the nature and scope of a company's activities, rather than requiring an assessment of the likelihood of the company's financial distress.

### Application to Crypto Firms (None Designated) <a href="#application-to-crypto-firms" id="application-to-crypto-firms"></a>

No crypto firm has been designated as a nonbank SIFI by FSOC. There is no public evidence that the Council formally initiated a Stage 1 or Stage 2 review of any specific crypto company. However, FSOC's language in its 2022 and 2023 annual reports -- that crypto-assets "could pose risks to the stability of the U.S." -- was consistent with building a predicate for potential future designations, and the 2023 revised designation guidance was viewed by commentators as potentially opening the door to designating large crypto firms or stablecoin issuers. In May 2025, the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation published a report analyzing the scope and limits of FSOC's designation authority. _See_ CCMR, [_Revisiting FSOC's Power to Designate Nonbank SIFIs_](https://capmktsreg.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FSOC-Non-Bank-SIFI-Report-05.12.25-FINAL.pdf) (2025.05).

Under the Trump administration, the political appetite for designating crypto firms as SIFIs has effectively disappeared. The 2025 Annual Report's removal of digital assets from the vulnerability list signals that SIFI designation for crypto firms is not on the current FSOC agenda. Congressional action -- the GENIUS Act and the pending Digital Asset Market Clarity Act ("CLARITY Act") -- has shifted the policy approach from designation-based oversight to legislative frameworks. The distinction is significant: SIFI designation subjects a company to Federal Reserve supervision and enhanced prudential standards, whereas legislative frameworks establish rules that apply to entire categories of market participants. The current trajectory favors the latter approach.

## FSOC Under the Trump Administration <a href="#fsoc-under-trump-administration" id="fsoc-under-trump-administration"></a>

### Policy Reversal Under Secretary Bessent <a href="#policy-reversal-under-bessent" id="policy-reversal-under-bessent"></a>

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, confirmed on January 27, 2025, brought a fundamentally different philosophy to FSOC's chairmanship. On January 23, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order "Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology," which revoked EO 14067 (the Biden order that had mandated the October 2022 FSOC report), prohibited agencies from establishing or promoting central bank digital currencies, established a Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets chaired by Special Advisor David Sacks, and directed evaluation of a national digital asset stockpile derived from crypto seized through federal law enforcement. _See_ [White House, Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/strengthening-american-leadership-in-digital-financial-technology/) (2025.01.23).

Secretary Bessent articulated a vision of "growth-centric financial stability," warning that "Federal agencies must avoid the temptation to create a zero-risk financial system, which would result in what others have called the stability of the graveyard." Under his leadership, FSOC underwent a structural overhaul: the Council shifted from broad vulnerability-focused assessments toward four discrete priority areas -- Treasury markets, cybersecurity, regulatory modernization, and AI -- and began preparing policy letters focused on removing regulations judged to impose "undue burdens" on economic growth rather than coordinating new restrictions.

In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee on February 4, 2026, Bessent described the GENIUS Act as "a turning point for U.S. competitiveness in digital assets" and noted that Treasury is required to complete implementing regulations by July 18, 2026. He pressed Congress to pass the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act ("CLARITY Act"), stating: "It's impossible to proceed without it. We have to get this Clarity Act across the finish line." Bessent also coined the term "crypto nihilists" to describe industry participants who prefer no regulation over comprehensive legislation, and acknowledged that deposit volatility from crypto is "very undesirable" for community banks that rely on deposit stability for community lending. _See_ [CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2026/02/05/u-s-treasury-s-bessent-calls-out-crypto-nihilists-resisting-market-structure-bill) (2026.02.05); [Bank Policy Institute](https://bpi.com/8-key-takeaways-from-the-house-and-senate-fsoc-hearings/) (2026.02.05).

### Digital Assets Working Group Transition <a href="#digital-assets-working-group-transition" id="digital-assets-working-group-transition"></a>

Under the Biden administration, FSOC served as the central hub for the whole-of-government approach to crypto regulation directed by EO 14067, with the Council's Digital Asset Working Group facilitating information sharing among member agencies. The October 2022 FSOC digital asset report was the flagship deliverable of this coordination effort, synthesizing input from all member agencies into a unified assessment.

However, coordination sometimes broke down in practice. The [SEC](https://www.thecod3x.com/sec/) under Chair Gensler pursued an aggressive enforcement-first approach to crypto regulation, asserting that most tokens were unregistered securities, while the [CFTC](https://www.thecod3x.com/cftc/) advocated for legislative expansion of its jurisdiction over spot commodity markets. These divergent approaches meant that the regulatory posture toward crypto was not always as unified as FSOC's annual reports suggested.

On the banking side, FSOC's member agencies achieved greater coordination. On January 3, 2023, [the Fed](https://www.thecod3x.com/thefed/), [FDIC](https://www.thecod3x.com/fdic/), and [OCC](https://www.thecod3x.com/occ/) issued a joint statement cautioning banks about crypto-asset engagement risks. On February 23, 2023, the same three agencies issued a second joint statement warning about liquidity risks to banking organizations from crypto-asset market vulnerabilities. These interagency statements -- issued by banking regulators acting as FSOC members -- reflected the Council's coordinated assessment that crypto presented safety and soundness risks to the banking sector. Under the Trump administration, both joint statements were rescinded, as noted in the FSOC 2025 Annual Report.

A Government Accountability Office report issued in August 2023 found that interagency coordination on crypto regulation was nonetheless inadequate, noting that neither the Federal Reserve nor the SEC had "regularly" convened coordination bodies and that "agencies are unable to specifically identify the full range of risks and regulatory challenges of existing and emerging blockchain products." _See_ GAO, [_Assessing Effectiveness Could Enhance Response to Systemic Risks_](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-105708.pdf) (2023.08).

Under the Trump administration, FSOC's coordinating role has been partially supplanted by the Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, which was directed by the January 2025 executive order to submit within 180 days a proposed federal regulatory framework for digital assets, including stablecoins. The working group is chaired by David Sacks, the President's Special Advisor for AI and Crypto, with members including the heads of the SEC, CFTC, and Treasury -- many of whom also sit on FSOC, creating overlapping but distinct coordination channels.

Additionally, the [SEC](https://www.thecod3x.com/sec/) and [CFTC](https://www.thecod3x.com/cftc/) announced "Project Crypto" on January 30, 2026, a joint initiative to harmonize federal oversight of digital asset markets that operates alongside but somewhat independent of FSOC. _See_ Morrison Foerster, [_SEC and CFTC Announce Joint 'Project Crypto' Initiative_](https://www.mofo.com/resources/insights/260130-sec-and-cftc-announce-joint-project-crypto-initiative) (2026.01.30). On the legislative front, the CLARITY Act -- which divides crypto assets into three categories (digital commodities, investment contract assets, and permitted payment stablecoins) and grants the [CFTC](https://www.thecod3x.com/cftc/) "exclusive jurisdiction" over digital commodity spot markets -- was approved by the House in July 2025 and is moving through the Senate as of early 2026. _See_ Arnold & Porter, [_Clarifying the CLARITY Act_](https://www.arnoldporter.com/en/perspectives/advisories/2025/08/clarifying-the-clarity-act) (2025.08).

The 2025 Annual Report reflects a posture in which legislative frameworks -- the GENIUS Act and the pending CLARITY Act -- are expected to address systemic risks more effectively than the ad hoc regulatory warnings that characterized the 2022-2024 period. The Council's annual reporting mandate under Dodd-Frank remains intact, and the GENIUS Act adds stablecoin stability monitoring to that mandate, ensuring that FSOC will continue to assess digital assets even as its institutional posture has shifted from warning to observation.
