# 1.21 - Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)

## Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is a bureau of the [U.S. Department of the Treasury](https://www.thecod3x.com/treasury/) charged with safeguarding the financial system from illicit use, combating money laundering, and promoting national security through the strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence. FinCEN administers the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), 31 U.S.C. sections 5311-5330 and 31 C.F.R. Chapter X, the nation's primary anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) statute. In that capacity, FinCEN serves as the United States' financial intelligence unit (FIU) and is the primary federal AML/CFT regulator for money services businesses (MSBs), including virtual currency exchanges and administrators.

FinCEN was among the first federal agencies to provide explicit guidance on the application of its regulations to cryptocurrency. Its 2013 guidance on convertible virtual currencies (CVCs) established the foundational framework that virtual currency exchangers and administrators are MSBs subject to BSA obligations -- a determination that has shaped the regulatory landscape for over a decade. The agency expanded that framework significantly in 2019 with comprehensive guidance covering dozens of business models, from peer-to-peer exchangers to decentralized applications.

FinCEN has also issued six administrative rulings addressing specific virtual currency business models, engaged in landmark enforcement actions -- including the $3.4 billion settlement with Binance in November 2023 (the largest in [Treasury](https://www.thecod3x.com/treasury/) Department history) -- and proposed (though not always finalized) rules addressing unhosted wallets and CVC mixing. Following the enactment of the GENIUS Act in July 2025, FinCEN is engaged in rulemaking to bring permitted payment stablecoin issuers within the BSA framework, marking the first time Congress has legislatively directed FinCEN to create a bespoke compliance regime for a specific category of digital asset business.

FinCEN's work in the digital asset space intersects with several other federal regulators and Treasury bureaus, including [OFAC](https://www.thecod3x.com/ofac/) (which has imposed sanctions on virtual currency mixers, exchanges, and wallet addresses), the [SEC](https://www.thecod3x.com/sec/) (which regulates digital asset securities), and the [CFTC](https://www.thecod3x.com/cftc/) (which oversees digital asset commodity derivatives). The three agencies issued a joint statement in 2019 confirming that BSA obligations apply to all covered financial institutions regardless of whether a digital asset is classified as a security, commodity, or derivative.

## Guidance <a href="#guidance" id="guidance"></a>

### Persons Administering, Exchanging, or Using Virtual Currencies <a href="#persons-administering-exchanging-or-using-virtual-currencies" id="persons-administering-exchanging-or-using-virtual-currencies"></a>

Starting in 2013, FinCEN issued guidance on the application of its freshly implemented (in 2011) rule regarding MSBs to those administering, exchanging, or using what it calls "convertible virtual currencies," (CVCs) which it defines as virtual currency that "either has an equivalent value in real currency, or acts as a substitute for real currency." FinCEN, FIN-2013-G001, [_Application of FinCEN's Regulations to Persons Administering, Exchanging, or Using Virtual Currencies_](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/FIN-2013-G001.pdf), at 1(2013.03.18).

In most situations, FinCEN concluded those who administer or provide an exchange platform for virtual currencies are subject to FinCEN's MSB regulations, but those who simply use CVCs for the purchase of goods or services are not. [_Id._](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/FIN-2013-G001.pdf) at 2-3. That conclusion holds whether the administrator or exchanger is centralized or decentralized. [_Id._](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/FIN-2013-G001.pdf) at 3-5.

### Certain Business Models Involving Convertible Virtual Currencies <a href="#certain-business-models-involving-convertible-virtual-currencies" id="certain-business-models-involving-convertible-virtual-currencies"></a>

In 2019, FinCEN expanded on its prior guidance to describe the application of its regulations to a wide variety of business models. FinCEN, FIN-2019-G001, [_Application of FinCEN's Regulations to Certain Business Models Involving Convertible Virtual Currencies_](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/2019-05/FinCEN%20Guidance%20CVC%20FINAL%20508.pdf) (2019.05.09). Weighing in at 30 pages, this significantly more comprehensive coverage still provides only basic guidance as to how FinCEN interprets its regulations to the wide variety of businesses making use of CVCs in one form or another. As seemingly minor facts can flip the determination of whether an individual or business is subject to FinCEN's regulations, entities who may come within FinCEN's regulatory ambit should thus carefully scrutinize the sections of this guidance that may be applicable to their activities and consider reaching out to FinCEN directly to provide individual guidance or an administrative ruling. _See_ [_id._](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/2019-05/FinCEN%20Guidance%20CVC%20FINAL%20508.pdf) at 30.

The guidance covers the below list of situations. Because the analysis is so fact specific, specific FinCEN conclusions as to the type of business are omitted.

* Natural persons providing CVC money transmission (P2P exchangers)
* CVC wallets (including hosted, unhosted, and multiple signature wallet providers)
* CVC kiosks / electronic terminals
* Decentralized Applications (DApps), DApp developers and users
* Anonymity-enhanced CVC transactions (including anonymizing services providers, anonymizing software provider, anonymity-enhanced CVC providers, and money transmitters that accept or transmit anonymity-enhanced CVCs)
* Payment processing services involving CVC money transmission
* Internet casinos
* CVC trading platforms and decentralized exchanges
* Raising funding for development or other projects, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)
* CVC creators, CVC miners, distributed applications for conducting CVC transactions
* Mining pools, cloud miners

For businesses that are MSBs, FinCEN advises that they must implement and maintain an "effective written anti-money laundering program" which must, at a minimum:

(a) incorporate policies, procedures and internal controls reasonably designed to assure ongoing compliance (including verifying customer identification, filing reports, creating and retaining records, and responding to law enforcement requests);

(b) designate an individual responsible to assure day-to-day compliance with the program and BSA requirements;

(c) provide training for appropriate personnel, including training in the detection of suspicious transactions; and,

(d) provide for independent review to monitor and maintain an adequate program.

[_Id._](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/2019-05/FinCEN%20Guidance%20CVC%20FINAL%20508.pdf) at 10. The program must make a risk-based determination of the MSB's exposure to criminal activity based on its customer profile. [_Id._](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/2019-05/FinCEN%20Guidance%20CVC%20FINAL%20508.pdf) And of course the business will have a variety of "recordkeeping, reporting, and transaction monitoring obligations" that are set forth in 31 CFR sections [1010](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-31/subtitle-B/chapter-X/part-1010?toc=1) and [1022](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-31/subtitle-B/chapter-X/part-1022?toc=1), such as filing suspicious activity reports (SARs) and currency transaction reports (CTRs). [_Id._](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/2019-05/FinCEN%20Guidance%20CVC%20FINAL%20508.pdf)

### Joint Statement on Activities Involving Digital Assets <a href="#joint-statement-on-activities-involving-digital-assets" id="joint-statement-on-activities-involving-digital-assets"></a>

In late 2019, FinCEN joined with the [CFTC](https://www.thecod3x.com/cftc/) and [SEC](https://www.thecod3x.com/sec/) to issue guidance on activities involving digital assets. CFTC, FinCEN, and SEC, [_Joint Statement on Activities Involving Digital Assets_](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/cftc-fincen-secjointstatementdigitalassets) (2019.10.11). The statement reminded entities that the BSA applies to all covered financial institutions, including transactions involving digital assets, and that covered financial institutions must have an AML/CFT program with respect to digital assets -- regardless of whether the asset is classified as a security, commodity, or derivative.

It further commented that entities need to be careful to analyze what type of asset they are handling and determine which regulatory body is appropriate to register with for that particular use case. FinCEN included a separate statement pointing to its recently issued guidance on CVCs, encouraged covered entities to review the guidance, and its application to money services businesses.

## Administrative Rulings <a href="#administrative-rulings" id="administrative-rulings"></a>

In 2014 and 2015, FinCEN issued six separate administrative rulings responding to various requests from sectors of the crypto industry. Those rulings addressed virtual currency mining operations, virtual currency software development and investment activity, renting computer systems for mining virtual currency, a virtual currency payment system, and a virtual currency trading platform.

Addressing virtual currency mining operations, FinCEN concluded that the act of mining Bitcoin and using it "solely for the user's own purposes and not for the benefit of another," means that "the user is _**not**_ an MSB under FinCEN's regulations, because these activities involve neither 'acceptance' nor 'transmission' of the convertible virtual currency and are not the transmission of funds within the meaning of the Rule." FinCEN, FIN-2014-R001, [_Application of FinCEN's Regulations to Virtual Currency Mining Operations_](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/FIN-2014-R001.pdf), at 3 (2014.01.30).

Addressing virtual currency software development and certain investment activity, FinCEN concluded that when a company invests periodically in convertible virtual currency and produces and distributes software to facilitate the company's investment in convertible virtual currency, the company is not a money services business for purposes of the BSA. FinCEN, FIN-2014-R002, [_Application of FinCEN's Regulations to Virtual Currency Software Development and Certain Investment Activity_](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/FIN-2014-R002.pdf), at 2, 4 (2014.01.30). This is because the mere production and distribution of software "does not constitute acceptance and transmission of value, even if the purpose of the software is to facilitate the sale of virtual currency," [_id._](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/FIN-2014-R002.pdf) at 2, and because, "when the Company invests in a convertible virtual currency for its own account, and when it realizes the value of its investment, it is acting as a user of that convertible virtual currency within the meaning of the guidance," [_id._](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/FIN-2014-R002.pdf) at 4, and is thus not an MSB pursuant to the BSA.

Addressing a company creating and renting a computer system for mining virtual currency, FinCEN concluded the mere creation of equipment that is rented out, even when intended for use in mining virtual currency, does not render the equipment creator an MSB because "regulations specifically exempt from money transmitter status a person that only provides the delivery, communication, or network data access services used by a money transmitter to supply money transmission services." FinCEN, FIN-2014-R007, [_Application of Money Services Business regulations to the rental of computer systems for mining virtual currency_](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/administrative\_ruling/FIN-2014-R007.pdf), at 2-3 (2014.04.29).

Addressing a virtual currency trading platform that would "match offers to buy and sell convertible virtual currency for currency of legal tender," FinCEN concluded the platform would be a money transmitter pursuant to the BSA because "\[a] person that accepts currency, funds, or any value that substitutes for currency, with the intent and/or effect of transmitting currency, funds, or any value that substitutes for currency to another person or location if a certain predetermined condition established by the transmitter is met, is a money transmitter under FinCEN's regulations." FinCEN, FIN-2014-R011, [_Application of FinCEN's Regulations to a Virtual Currency Trading Platform_](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/administrative\_ruling/FIN-2014-R011.pdf), at 3 (2014.10.29). That is true "regardless of whether the exchanger acts as a broker (attempting to match two (mostly) simultaneous and offsetting transactions involving the acceptance of one type of currency and the transmission of another) or as a dealer (transacting from its own reserve in either convertible virtual currency or real currency)." [_Id._](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/administrative\_ruling/FIN-2014-R011.pdf) at 6.

Addressing a virtual currency payment system, FinCEN concluded that a company that takes credit card payments from consumers and sends the equivalent (less a fee) in Bitcoin to the merchant is a money transmitter. FinCEN, FIN-2014-R012, [_Application of FinCEN's Regulations to a Virtual Currency Payment System_](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/administrative\_ruling/FIN-2014-R012.pdf), at 3 (2014.10.27). It reached that conclusion for the reasons stated above with respect to a trading platform -- acting as a broker or dealer still satisfies being a money transmitter -- and thus was an "exchanger" for purposes of the BSA. FinCEN further rejected that the company qualified for any exemption, because (a) it was not operating exclusively in a clearing and settlement system that accepts only BSA-regulated financial institutions, and (b) money transmission was the sole purpose of the business, not an integral component of another related activity. [_Id._](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/administrative\_ruling/FIN-2014-R012.pdf) at 4-5.

Addressing a company that created digital certificates of ownership of precious metals and jewels that could be transferred via the Bitcoin blockchain rails, FinCEN concluded that the business was a money transmitter because the digital certificates were meant to facilitate exchange between the initial customer and a third party. FinCEN, FIN-2015-R001, [_Application of FinCEN's Regulations to Persons Issuing Physical or Digital Negotiable Certificates of Ownership of Precious Metals_](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/administrative\_ruling/FIN-2015-R001.pdf), at 3 (2015.08.14). Additionally, the company did not qualify for an exemption for e-currencies or e-precious metals because "the Company is going beyond the activities of a broker or dealer in commodities and is acting as a convertible virtual currency administrator (with the freely transferable digital certificates being the commodity-backed virtual currency)." [_Id._](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/administrative\_ruling/FIN-2015-R001.pdf) at 4.

## Enforcement Actions <a href="#enforcement-actions" id="enforcement-actions"></a>

FinCEN's enforcement record in the cryptocurrency space has grown substantially since the agency's first actions in 2015, escalating from six- and seven-figure penalties against early market participants to the multi-billion-dollar Binance settlement in 2023. Taken together, these actions demonstrate FinCEN's consistent position that BSA obligations apply fully to virtual currency businesses, and that willful noncompliance -- whether through failure to register, failure to implement AML programs, or failure to file suspicious activity reports -- will result in severe consequences.

### Early Enforcement: Ripple Labs and BTC-E <a href="#early-enforcement-ripple-labs-and-btc-e" id="early-enforcement-ripple-labs-and-btc-e"></a>

Two notable enforcement actions came after FinCEN's first guidance but before its second. In 2015, FinCEN ordered Ripple Labs, Inc. to pay $700,000 for its willful violations of the Bank Secrecy Act's registration, record keeping, and reporting requirements. FinCEN, [_In re Ripple Labs, Inc._ _(Assessment of Civil Money Penalty)_](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/Ripple\_Assessment.pdf), No. 2015-05 (2015.05.15). FinCEN found that Ripple had also failed to implement an effective anti-money laundering program. This fine came at the same time as a $450,000 forfeiture agreed to by Ripple with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California. _See_ U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_Settlement Agreement_](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/05/05/settlement\_agreement.pdf) (2015.05.05). Given that XRP, the Ripple token, had a market cap of approximately $700 million at the time of the fines, this appears to be a relatively light penalty.

In 2017, FinCEN fined BTC-E over $110 million, and its founder Alexander Vinnik $12 million. FinCEN, [_In re BTC-E (Assessment of Civil Money Penalty)_](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/enforcement\_action/2017-07-26/Assessment%20for%20BTCeVinnik%20FINAL%20SignDate%2007.26.17.pdf), No. 2017-03 (2017.07.26). The fines arose out of BTC-E's failure to register as an MSB, its lack of controls to monitor compliance with FinCEN regulations, or to keep the records or file the reports required by those regulations, and its efforts to direct users on how (despite being physically in the United States) they could evade the appearance of being in the United States by going through intermediaries. Additional minor enforcement actions have occurred, including a $35,000 fine and industry bar against an individual engaged as a peer-to-peer currency exchanger. FinCEN, News Release, [_FinCEN Penalizes Peer-to-Peer Virtual Currency Exchanger for Violations of Anti-Money Laundering Laws_](https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-penalizes-peer-peer-virtual-currency-exchanger-violations-anti-money) (2019.04.18).

### BitMEX ($100M, August 2021) <a href="#bitmex" id="bitmex"></a>

On August 10, 2021, FinCEN and the [CFTC](https://www.thecod3x.com/cftc/) jointly assessed a $100 million civil money penalty against HDR Global Trading Limited, doing business as BitMEX, one of the oldest and largest CVC derivatives exchanges. FinCEN, [_FinCEN Announces $100 Million Enforcement Action Against Unregistered Futures Commission Merchant BitMEX_](https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-announces-100-million-enforcement-action-against-unregistered-futures) (2021.08.10). The action was the first FinCEN enforcement against a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM).

FinCEN found that BitMEX willfully failed to establish and implement an AML program and a Customer Identification Program (CIP) for over six years, instead advertising that sign-up "takes less than 30 seconds and requires no personal information." FinCEN, [_Assessment of Civil Money Penalty (BitMEX)_](https://www.fincen.gov/system/files/enforcement_action/2021-08-10/Assessment_BITMEX_508_FINAL.pdf) (2021.08.10). During that period, BitMEX conducted at least $209 million in transactions with known darknet markets or unregistered MSBs providing mixing services, and failed to file SARs on at least 588 specific suspicious transactions. Senior leadership altered U.S. customer information to conceal customer locations.

The consent order required BitMEX to engage an independent consultant to conduct a SAR lookback analysis and to pay a $100 million civil money penalty, which was partially offset by a $50 million credit for the parallel CFTC settlement.

### Bittrex ($29M, October 2022) <a href="#bittrex" id="bittrex"></a>

In October 2022, FinCEN (along with [OFAC](https://www.thecod3x.com/ofac/)) settled with Bittrex, Inc. for over $29 million in the first-ever parallel FinCEN-OFAC enforcement action in the cryptocurrency space. [Treasury](https://www.thecod3x.com/treasury/), [_Treasury Announces Two Enforcement Actions for over $24M and $29M Against Virtual Currency Exchange Bittrex, Inc._](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1006) (2022.10.11).

The settlement resulted from Bittrex's failure to maintain an effective AML program and its failure to file any SARs for over three years (February 2014 through May 2017), during which time it relied on as few as two employees with minimal AML training to manually review all transactions -- which at times exceeded 20,000 per day. Bittrex also processed over 116,000 transactions valued at over $260 million involving entities and individuals in OFAC-sanctioned jurisdictions, including Iran, Cuba, Sudan, Syria, and the Crimea region. FinCEN, [_FinCEN Announces $29 Million Enforcement Action Against Virtual Asset Service Provider Bittrex_](https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-announces-29-million-enforcement-action-against-virtual-asset-service) (2022.10.11).

OFAC assessed a concurrent $24,280,829.20 penalty, which FinCEN credited against its own assessment, bringing Bittrex's total payment to $29,280,829.20.

### Binance ($3.4B FinCEN / $4.3B Total, November 2023) <a href="#binance" id="binance"></a>

On November 21, 2023, FinCEN announced the largest enforcement settlement in [U.S. Treasury](https://www.thecod3x.com/treasury/) Department history: a $3.4 billion civil money penalty against Binance Holdings Limited, the world's largest virtual currency exchange by trading volume. FinCEN, [_FinCEN Announces Largest Settlement in U.S. Treasury Department History with Virtual Asset Service Provider Binance_](https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-announces-largest-settlement-us-treasury-department-history-virtual-asset) (2023.11.21). The action was part of a coordinated, multi-agency resolution involving the Department of Justice, [CFTC](https://www.thecod3x.com/cftc/), and [OFAC](https://www.thecod3x.com/ofac/), with the total cross-agency resolution amounting to approximately $4.3 billion. [Treasury](https://www.thecod3x.com/treasury/), [_Press Release jy1925_](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1925) (2023.11.21).

FinCEN found that Binance willfully violated the BSA in three principal respects.

First, Binance operated as an unregistered MSB while obscuring its ties to U.S. customers and the U.S. market. Despite public representations that it did not serve U.S. persons, Binance maintained its most commercially important U.S. customers and instructed certain high-value users on how to evade geographic restrictions. Internal communications revealed that Binance's compliance infrastructure was deliberately designed to avoid triggering U.S. regulatory obligations while continuing to profit from U.S.-sourced trading volume.

Second, Binance willfully failed to establish, implement, and maintain an effective AML program, including failing to perform adequate Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures on a substantial portion of its user base. For years, Binance permitted users to open accounts and conduct transactions with minimal or no identity verification.

Third, and perhaps most significantly, Binance willfully failed to file over 100,000 Suspicious Activity Reports on transactions it processed involving terrorist organizations (including Hamas, al-Qaeda, and ISIS), ransomware operators, child sexual exploitation material (CSAM) purveyors, darknet marketplaces, and various fraud schemes. The sheer volume of unfiled SARs -- over 100,000 -- was itself unprecedented in any BSA enforcement action and reflected years of systemic noncompliance rather than isolated failures. FinCEN, [_Consent Order No. 2023-04_](https://www.fincen.gov/system/files/enforcement_action/2023-11-21/FinCEN_Consent_Order_2023-04_FINAL508.pdf) (2023.11.21).

In a parallel [OFAC](https://www.thecod3x.com/ofac/) action, OFAC found that between August 2017 and October 2022, Binance had executed more than 1.67 million virtual currency trades between U.S. persons and users in sanctioned jurisdictions and blocked persons, resulting in a $968 million OFAC settlement.

The consent order imposed a five-year monitorship with a broad mandate to assess and monitor Binance's compliance, evaluate the effectiveness of its BSA compliance program, and provide Treasury with access to Binance's books, records, and systems for the full five-year period. Binance was further required to ensure it does not offer services to U.S. persons and to implement significantly enhanced AML/KYC programs. [_Id._](https://www.fincen.gov/system/files/enforcement_action/2023-11-21/FinCEN_Consent_Order_2023-04_FINAL508.pdf)

As part of the resolution, Binance CEO Changpeng "CZ" Zhao resigned as CEO and pleaded guilty to criminal charges brought by the Department of Justice. He was subsequently sentenced to four months in federal prison. The Binance action underscored the principle that operating offshore does not insulate a virtual currency exchange from BSA obligations when it serves U.S. customers, and that the scale of unfiled SARs and the nature of the underlying criminal activity -- particularly terrorism financing -- will drive penalties to commensurate levels. The five-year monitorship also signaled Treasury's intent to ensure that the world's largest exchange could not simply pay the fine and resume noncompliant operations.

### Bitcoin Fog (Sterlingov, Sentenced November 2024) <a href="#bitcoin-fog" id="bitcoin-fog"></a>

Roman Sterlingov, a dual Russian-Swedish national, operated Bitcoin Fog, the darknet's longest-running cryptocurrency mixer, from 2011 to 2021. While prosecuted primarily by the Department of Justice rather than through a FinCEN civil enforcement action, the case centered on BSA violations that formed the basis of multiple felony charges, including operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and failure to register with FinCEN. U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_Bitcoin Fog Operator Convicted of Money Laundering Conspiracy_](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/bitcoin-fog-operator-convicted-money-laundering-conspiracy) (2024.03.12).

Sterlingov was convicted in March 2024. Bitcoin Fog had processed transactions involving over 1.2 million bitcoin -- valued at approximately $400 million at the time of the transactions -- the bulk of which originated from darknet marketplaces connected to narcotics trafficking, computer crimes, identity theft, and CSAM.

On November 8, 2024, Sterlingov was sentenced to 12 years and 6 months in federal prison, with a forfeiture money judgment of $395,563,025.39, forfeiture of seized cryptocurrencies and monetary assets valued at approximately $1.76 million, and forfeiture of the Bitcoin Fog wallet totaling approximately 1,345 bitcoin (valued at over $103 million at the time of sentencing). U.S. Dep't of Justice, [_Bitcoin Fog Operator Sentenced for Money Laundering Conspiracy_](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/bitcoin-fog-operator-sentenced-money-laundering-conspiracy) (2024.11.08). The sentence was one of the longest imposed in a cryptocurrency-related BSA prosecution and reflected both the duration of the illicit operation and the gravity of the underlying crimes it facilitated.

### Helix (Harmon, $60M) <a href="#helix" id="helix"></a>

On October 19, 2020, FinCEN assessed a $60 million civil money penalty against Larry Dean Harmon, the founder and operator of Helix (2014-2017) and Coin Ninja (2017-2020), both CVC mixers or "tumblers." This was FinCEN's first enforcement action against a bitcoin mixer. FinCEN, [_In the Matter of Larry Dean Harmon d/b/a Helix_](https://www.fincen.gov/news/enforcement-actions/matter-larry-dean-harmon-dba-helix) (2020.10.19).

From June 2014 through December 2017, Helix conducted over 1,225,000 transactions associated with over $311 million in virtual currency. Harmon failed to register as an MSB, implement AML programs, file SARs, or collect and verify customer identifiers on over 1.2 million transactions. When Harmon failed to pay the assessed penalty, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia filed a civil complaint on behalf of FinCEN in October 2022 seeking the $60 million, and a federal court ultimately ordered Harmon to pay the full civil penalty. The Helix action established the precedent that CVC mixing services are money transmission subject to BSA requirements -- a principle that FinCEN would later seek to codify through its October 2023 CVC mixing NPRM.

### Paxful ($3.5M, December 2025) <a href="#paxful" id="paxful"></a>

On December 9, 2025, FinCEN assessed a $3,500,000 civil money penalty against Paxful, Inc. and Paxful USA, Inc., a convertible virtual currency peer-to-peer trading platform. FinCEN, [_FinCEN Assesses $3.5 Million Penalty Against Paxful for Facilitating Suspicious Activity_](https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-assesses-35-million-penalty-against-paxful-facilitating-suspicious) (2025.12.09).

Paxful had initially registered with FinCEN in July 2015 but allowed its registration to lapse, operating as an unregistered MSB for 974 days before re-registering on September 3, 2019. FinCEN found that Paxful failed to implement an effective AML program, failed to file timely SARs, and facilitated more than $500 million in suspicious activity involving illicit actors -- including transactions with individuals in Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela, and transactions with Backpage.com, a website seized by DOJ in 2018 for facilitating sex trafficking. FinCEN further found that Paxful leadership actively instructed employees not to raise or report compliance issues. [_Id._](https://www.fincen.gov/system/files/2025-12/PaxfulConsentOrder.pdf)

Alongside this action, FinCEN published its first set of "Compliance Considerations," providing the broader industry with guidance on common compliance failures observed across its enforcement docket. This marked an evolution in FinCEN's approach, supplementing punitive enforcement with affirmative guidance designed to improve industry-wide compliance.

## Proposed Rulemaking <a href="#proposed-rulemaking" id="proposed-rulemaking"></a>

### Unhosted Wallet Rule (Proposed December 2020, Withdrawn April 2024) <a href="#unhosted-wallet-rule" id="unhosted-wallet-rule"></a>

In late 2020, FinCEN proposed a rule to make explicit (and with the force of law) the obligations of banks and MSBs with respect to CVCs. _See_ U.S. Treasury, [_The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Proposes Rule Aimed at Closing Anti-Money Laundering Regulatory Gaps for Certain Convertible Virtual Currency and Digital Asset Transactions_](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1216) (2020.12.18); FinCEN, [_Requirements for Certain Transactions Involving Convertible Virtual Currency or Digital Assets_](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-12-23/pdf/2020-28437.pdf), 85 Fed. Reg. 83840 (proposed 2020.12.23) (to be codified at 31 C.F.R. pts. 1010, 1020, 1022).

The proposed rule would have imposed on banks and money services businesses the formal requirement to report CVC transactions exceeding $10,000 to FinCEN. The proposed rule would further have required banks and MSBs to keep records of the CVC transaction history of their customers (including the counterparties) if the counterparty uses an unhosted wallet and the transaction exceeded $3,000. (Both "bank" and "money services business" are defined by regulation in [31 C.F.R. section 1010.100](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-31/subtitle-B/chapter-X/part-1010/subpart-A/section-1010.100).)

The initial 15-day comment period drew significant criticism as inadequate, and FinCEN reopened and extended the comment period through March 29, 2021. _See_ FinCEN, [_Requirements for Certain Transactions Involving Convertible Virtual Currency or Digital Assets_](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-12-23/pdf/2020-28437.pdf) (Extension Notice), 86 Fed. Reg. 7352 (issued 2021.01.28). After years of substantial industry pushback questioning the technical feasibility and privacy implications of the proposed requirements, FinCEN formally withdrew the proposed rule on April 12, 2024. FinCEN, [_Withdrawal of Proposed Rulemaking: Requirements for Certain Transactions Involving Convertible Virtual Currency or Digital Assets_](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2024-08-16/html/2024-16461.htm), 89 Fed. Reg. 66744 (published 2024.08.16). The rule was never finalized.

### CVC Mixing Rule (Proposed October 2023, Section 311, Pending) <a href="#cvc-mixing-rule" id="cvc-mixing-rule"></a>

On October 19, 2023, FinCEN published a landmark Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to designate international convertible virtual currency mixing as a class of transactions of primary money laundering concern under Section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act (31 U.S.C. section 5318A). FinCEN, [_Proposal of Special Measure Regarding Convertible Virtual Currency Mixing as a Class of Transactions of Primary Money Laundering Concern_](https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-proposes-new-regulation-enhance-transparency-convertible-virtual-currency) (2023.10.19); 88 Fed. Reg. 72701 (2023.10.23). This was the first time FinCEN invoked Section 311 authority to target a class of transactions rather than a specific institution, jurisdiction, or type of account.

The NPRM would require covered financial institutions (including banks and MSBs) to report to FinCEN any CVC transactions involving CVC mixing with a foreign jurisdiction nexus within 30 calendar days of initial detection, and to maintain records on such transactions including CVC type, mixer used, wallet addresses, transaction hashes, dates, IP addresses, and a narrative describing the activity. The proposed rule defined "CVC mixing" broadly as the facilitation of CVC transactions in a manner that obfuscates the source, destination, or amount involved -- a definition that would capture both centralized mixer services and decentralized protocol-level mixing.

FinCEN cited the use of CVC mixing by Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), ransomware operators, and darknet marketplace operators to justify the measure. _See_ FinCEN, [_NPRM Full Text_](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/federal_register_notices/2023-10-19/FinCEN_311MixingNPRM_FINAL.pdf) (2023.10.19).

The comment period closed on January 22, 2024, and generated significant industry pushback, including a detailed comment letter from the Blockchain Association arguing the rule was overly broad and could capture legitimate privacy-preserving activities. As of February 2026, the CVC mixing proposed rule has not been finalized. Under the Trump administration (beginning January 2025), which has generally taken a more crypto-friendly regulatory posture, finalization appears unlikely in the near term. However, the rule has not been formally withdrawn.

Notably, FinCEN's subsequent use of Section 311 authority against the Cambodia-based Huione Group -- which FinCEN designated as a "foreign financial institution of primary money laundering concern" on May 1, 2025, and against which it issued a final rule severing access to the U.S. financial system on October 15, 2025 -- demonstrates that Section 311 remains an active tool in the agency's enforcement toolkit, even as the broader CVC mixing NPRM remains pending. FinCEN, [_FinCEN Finds Cambodia-Based Huione Group to Be of Primary Money Laundering Concern_](https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-finds-cambodia-based-huione-group-be-primary-money-laundering-concern) (2025.05.01); FinCEN, [_FinCEN Issues Final Rule Severing Huione Group from U.S. Financial System_](https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-issues-final-rule-severing-huione-group-us-financial-system) (2025.10.15). FinCEN found that Huione Group laundered at least $4 billion in illicit proceeds between August 2021 and January 2025, including at least $37 million from DPRK cyber heists and at least $36 million from CVC investment scams ("pig butchering" schemes).

## GENIUS Act Implementation <a href="#genius-act" id="genius-act"></a>

### Permitted Payment Stablecoin Issuers <a href="#permitted-payment-stablecoin-issuers" id="permitted-payment-stablecoin-issuers"></a>

The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act) was signed into law on July 18, 2025. The statute classifies stablecoin issuers as "permitted payment stablecoin issuers" (PPSIs) and brings them within the BSA framework as a new category of "financial institution" under FinCEN regulations. FinCEN is directed to promulgate tailored AML/CFT rules for PPSIs, scaled to the "size and complexity" of each issuer. The statute thus marks the first time Congress has legislatively mandated that FinCEN create a bespoke compliance regime for a specific category of digital asset business.

### ANPRM (September 2025) <a href="#genius-act-anprm" id="genius-act-anprm"></a>

On September 19, 2025, [Treasury](https://www.thecod3x.com/treasury/) published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) seeking public comment on implementation of the GENIUS Act, including BSA/AML obligations for permitted payment stablecoin issuers. FinCEN, [_Treasury Seeks Public Comment on Implementation of the GENIUS Act_](https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/treasury-seeks-public-comment-implementation-genius-act) (2025.09.19); 90 Fed. Reg. [Doc. No. 2025-18226] (2025.09.19). In August 2025, Treasury also issued a separate Request for Comment on innovative methods for detecting illicit activity involving digital assets, including artificial intelligence and blockchain monitoring tools. The ANPRM comment process is ongoing as of February 2026, and final rules implementing the GENIUS Act's BSA provisions are expected to follow.

## Leadership <a href="#leadership" id="leadership"></a>

### Kenneth Blanco (2017-2021) <a href="#kenneth-blanco" id="kenneth-blanco"></a>

Kenneth A. Blanco served as FinCEN Director from December 2017 through April 9, 2021, appointed by President Trump. During his tenure, FinCEN issued its comprehensive 2019 CVC guidance, the Joint Statement with the [CFTC](https://www.thecod3x.com/cftc/) and [SEC](https://www.thecod3x.com/sec/), and proposed the unhosted wallet rule. Blanco was a vocal advocate for BSA compliance in the virtual currency industry, delivering notable public remarks on the subject at the 2018 Chicago-Kent Block (Legal) Tech Conference. FinCEN, [_Prepared Remarks of FinCEN Director Kenneth A. Blanco_](https://www.fincen.gov/news/speeches/prepared-remarks-fincen-director-kenneth-blanco-delivered-2018-chicago-kent-block) (2018.08.09). He departed FinCEN to take a position at Citigroup. Michael Mosier served as Acting Director briefly from April through August 2021. FinCEN, [_FinCEN Announces Acting Director and New Deputy Director_](https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-announces-acting-director-and-new-deputy-director) (2021.04.09).

### Himamauli Das (Acting, 2021-2023) <a href="#himamauli-das" id="himamauli-das"></a>

Himamauli "Him" Das was appointed Acting Director of FinCEN in August 2021 and served in that capacity for over two years. FinCEN, [_FinCEN Announces New Acting Director_](https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-announces-new-acting-director) (2021.08). During his tenure, FinCEN oversaw the BitMEX and Bittrex enforcement actions, initial implementation of the Corporate Transparency Act, and ongoing cryptocurrency rulemaking efforts. FinCEN operated without a Senate-confirmed Director throughout Das's tenure.

### Andrea Gacki (2023-present) <a href="#andrea-gacki" id="andrea-gacki"></a>

Andrea M. Gacki assumed the role of FinCEN Director in September 2023. FinCEN, [_Treasury Department Announces Andrea Gacki as New Director of FinCEN_](https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/treasury-department-announces-andrea-gacki-new-director-fincen) (2023.07.12). Gacki previously served as Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control ([OFAC](https://www.thecod3x.com/ofac/)) from 2019 to 2023, where she oversaw U.S. economic sanctions implementation during major national security crises, including Russia-Ukraine sanctions.

Under Gacki's leadership, FinCEN announced the Binance settlement (the largest in Treasury Department history), proposed the CVC mixing rule under Section 311 authority, took the Section 311 action against the Huione Group, and assessed the Paxful penalty. Gacki has testified before the House Financial Services Committee (February 2024) and the Subcommittee on National Security, Illicit Finance, and International Financial Institutions (September 2025) on AML modernization and digital asset regulation. As of February 2026, Gacki continues to serve as FinCEN Director under the second Trump administration.

## Statements <a href="#statements" id="statements"></a>

In May 2022, FinCEN's Associate Director of Enforcement and Compliance gave a talk at the Chainalysis Links conference noting that Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) can only achieve their full potential if they "proactively adopt and uphold high standards for compliance," which means implementing "a rigorous risk-based approach to compliance and to \[their] customer relationships and transactional activity." Alessio Evangelista, Associate Director, Enforcement and Compliance Division, [_Prepared Remarks During Chainalysis Links Conference_](https://www.fincen.gov/news/speeches/prepared-remarks-alessio-evangelista-associate-director-enforcement-and-compliance) (2022.05.19). He further warned of VASPs that are "willing to do business with problematic companies up until the day of an OFAC designation or criminal indictment, even when there were clearly observable red flags and indicators of wrongdoing that they could -- and arguably should -- have taken note of long ago." Such businesses, he warned, could find themselves on the wrong end of an enforcement action, particularly where "there is a willful disregard for regulatory requirements." He concluded his remarks, however, by seeking partnership with the industry "to prioritize transparency and accountability, and to share information" in a way that will "raise the bar for the next generation of financial services."

In August 2018, FinCEN Director Kenneth Blanco gave remarks at the Chicago-Kent Block (Legal) Tech Conference at the Chicago-Kent College of Law. [_Prepared Remarks of FinCEN Director Kenneth A. Blanco_](https://www.fincen.gov/news/speeches/prepared-remarks-fincen-director-kenneth-blanco-delivered-2018-chicago-kent-block) (2018.08.09). In those remarks, Blanco discussed FinCEN's approach to virtual currency and financial innovation and the value of BSA filings in executing FinCEN's mission. Regarding its approach to virtual currency, Blanco stated generally that FinCEN supports innovation but must try to prevent innovation from empowering criminal enterprises to use money to support their activities in a way they otherwise could not. Blanco also covered the history of guidance and administrative rulings FinCEN had issued.

Regarding enforcement, Blanco remarked that examination programs of registered virtual currency businesses had led to "SAR filings from virtual exchanges ris\[ing] tremendously over the past few years," resulting in "over 1,500 SARs per month describing suspicious activity involving virtual currency." [_Id._](https://www.fincen.gov/news/speeches/prepared-remarks-fincen-director-kenneth-blanco-delivered-2018-chicago-kent-block) He also stressed that FinCEN expects entities to be proactive about compliance, commenting that "\[c]ompliance does not begin because you may get caught, or because you are about to be discovered. . . . It is not a culture we will tolerate." [_Id._](https://www.fincen.gov/news/speeches/prepared-remarks-fincen-director-kenneth-blanco-delivered-2018-chicago-kent-block)

In February 2018, Drew Maloney, the Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs at the Department of the Treasury, responded to a letter from Senator Ron Wyden that sought information regarding FinCEN's oversight and enforcement of virtual currency financial activities. Drew Maloney, Ass't Sec. for Leg. Affairs, [_Letter to Sen. Ron Wyden_](https://www.thecod3x.com/content/files/2022/04/fincen-ico-letter-march-2018-coin-center.pdf) (2018.02.13).

Maloney highlighted that FinCEN has a team of analysts that specifically review BSA filings from virtual currency money services businesses, "including filings pertaining to digital coin tokens, and Initial Coin Offerings" and highlighting FinCEN's 2013 guidance. [_Id._](https://www.thecod3x.com/content/files/2022/04/fincen-ico-letter-march-2018-coin-center.pdf) at 1. Maloney further explained that FinCEN has "\[b]lockchain network analytic tools \[that] can also tie a targeted bitcoin address to other potentially identifiable persons that have transacted with the particular bitcoin address and may have information that could potentially help identify beneficial owners," and such analysis is further supported by traditional investigative methods such as issuing subpoenas to virtual currency businesses.

Maloney also revealed that since 2014, FinCEN had examined about one third of the 100 registered virtual currency exchangers and administrators, and highlighted several enforcement actions. [_Id._](https://www.thecod3x.com/content/files/2022/04/fincen-ico-letter-march-2018-coin-center.pdf) at 2.
