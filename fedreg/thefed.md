# 1.30 - Federal Reserve Board (the Fed)

## Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

The Federal Reserve Board (the "Fed") occupies a central position in the regulation and supervision of digital asset activities by U.S. banking organizations. Between January 2022 and February 2026, the Fed's posture toward cryptocurrency and digital assets underwent a dramatic three-phase transformation, mirroring a broader shift in U.S. financial regulatory policy.

In the first phase -- cautious exploration (January 2022 through December 2022) -- the Fed published its landmark discussion paper on central bank digital currencies ("CBDCs"), released results from Project Hamilton (a collaborative CBDC research effort with MIT), and issued SR 22-6 requiring all Fed-supervised banking organizations to notify their lead supervisory contact before engaging in crypto-asset-related activities. Vice Chair Lael Brainard championed CBDC exploration while Governor Christopher Waller and Governor Michelle Bowman expressed skepticism. The period was characterized by active research and a "proceed with caution" orientation. _See_ Federal Reserve Board of Governors, [_Money and Payments: The U.S. Dollar in the Age of Digital Transformation_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/money-and-payments-discussion-paper.htm) (2022.01.20); The Fed, SR 22-6, [_Engagement in Crypto-Asset-Related Activities by Federal Reserve-Supervised Banking Organizations_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/SR2206.htm) (2022.08.16).

In the second phase -- restrictive posture (January 2023 through January 2025) -- the collapses of FTX (November 2022), Silvergate Bank (March 2023), Silicon Valley Bank (March 2023), and Signature Bank (March 2023) prompted a significantly more cautious approach. The Fed, along with the [OCC](https://www.thecod3x.com/occ/) and [FDIC](https://www.thecod3x.com/fdic/), issued two joint statements warning of crypto-asset risks in January and February 2023. Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr established the Novel Activities Supervision Program (SR 23-7) and a nonobjection process for dollar token activities (SR 23-8) in August 2023. The Fed denied Custodia Bank's master account application in January 2023. Vice Chair Brainard departed the Board in February 2023, removing its most prominent CBDC advocate. Project Hamilton concluded in December 2022. Critics labeled the cumulative effect of these actions "Operation Chokepoint 2.0," alleging a coordinated effort to restrict banking services for the crypto industry.

In the third phase -- liberalization (January 2025 through the present) -- the incoming Trump administration catalyzed a rapid reversal. Executive Order 14178, signed on January 23, 2025, prohibited all federal agencies from establishing, issuing, or promoting CBDCs. _See_ [Executive Actions](https://www.thecod3x.com/exec/). Vice Chair Barr stepped down from his supervision role on February 28, 2025. Chair Jerome Powell declared in February 11, 2025 testimony that the Fed would "never" issue a CBDC during his tenure. On April 24, 2025, the Fed withdrew all crypto-specific supervisory guidance -- SR 22-6, SR 23-8, and both 2023 joint statements -- in coordination with the OCC and FDIC. The Novel Activities Supervision Program was sunset on August 15, 2025. Michelle Bowman was confirmed as Vice Chair for Supervision on June 4, 2025, and signaled a pro-innovation approach. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (the "GENIUS Act"), signed into law on July 18, 2025, assigned the Fed a defined role in the new federal stablecoin framework. _See_ [Treasury](https://www.thecod3x.com/treasury/); [FSOC](https://www.thecod3x.com/fsoc/). Governor Waller proposed "skinny master accounts" for payment innovators in October 2025. By December 2025, the Fed had issued a revised policy statement opening the door for uninsured state member banks to engage in crypto-asset activities under a "different activity, different risks, different regulation" framework.

As of February 2026, with Kevin Warsh nominated on January 30, 2026 to succeed Powell as Chair (Powell's term expires May 15, 2026), the Fed's regulatory environment for digital assets has shifted from restriction to facilitation, while the FedNow instant payment service -- launched July 20, 2023 -- has grown to over 1,500 participating institutions, strengthening the case against a retail CBDC.

## CBDC Research and Policy <a href="#cbdc-research-and-policy" id="cbdc-research-and-policy"></a>

### Money and Payments Discussion Paper (January 2022) <a href="#money-and-payments-discussion-paper" id="money-and-payments-discussion-paper"></a>

On January 20, 2022, the Federal Reserve Board released its first major discussion paper examining the potential benefits and risks of a U.S. CBDC. Federal Reserve Board of Governors, [_Money and Payments: The U.S. Dollar in the Age of Digital Transformation_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/money-and-payments-discussion-paper.htm) (2022.01.20) (hereafter, "_Money and Payments_"). The paper identified four key characteristics of what the Fed believed would be an effective CBDC:

* privacy-protected;
* intermediated;
* widely transferable; and
* identity-verified.

[_Id._](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/money-and-payments-discussion-paper.htm) at 1-2. The paper explicitly disclaimed any specific policy position, noting at the outset: "The paper is not intended to advance any specific policy outcome, nor is it intended to signal that the Federal Reserve will make any imminent decisions about the appropriateness of issuing a U.S. CBDC." [_Id._](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/money-and-payments-discussion-paper.htm) at 1, 2. The Fed solicited public comment on more than twenty questions, with a 120-day comment period closing on May 20, 2022. The Fed received and compiled thousands of public comments from individuals, financial institutions, trade associations, advocacy groups, academics, and technology companies. _See_ Federal Reserve Board of Governors, [_Public Comments on Money and Payments_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/cbdc-public-comments.htm) (2022.05.20). Regardless of comments and public engagement, the Fed stated it would not issue a CBDC without "clear support from the executive branch and from Congress, ideally in the form of a specific authorizing law." [_Money and Payments_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/money-and-payments-discussion-paper.htm) at 3, 21.

As of June 17, 2022, Chair Jerome Powell indicated that "a U.S. CBDC could also potentially help maintain the dollar's international standing." Chair Jerome H. Powell, [_Welcoming Remarks at the "International Roles of the U.S. Dollar"_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220617a.htm) (2022.06.17). That position would prove short-lived; by 2024-2025, Powell had moved sharply away from CBDC advocacy.

### Key Considerations in a CBDC <a href="#key-considerations-in-a-cbdc" id="key-considerations-in-a-cbdc"></a>

To understand the Fed's concerns with issuing a CBDC, it is first imperative to understand the current state of money as used in the existing financial system. American cash money is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government, meaning that a $100 bill (or bills of any other denomination issued by the [Treasury](https://www.thecod3x.com/treasury/)) will be honored for its face value. However, a vast majority of consumers no longer rely primarily on cash. Instead, cash is deposited into national and local banks and credit unions. When cash is deposited into a bank or credit union, the consumer or business enters into a deposit agreement with the financial institution whereby the institution promises to repay the amounts deposited upon demand of the consumer. It is essentially a very low cost loan from the consumer to the financial institution that can be called for payment at any time.

The key here is that the financial institution makes a promise to pay the consumer. It is thus a liability of the financial institution to the consumer, not of the U.S. Government, that backs the cash deposited into the financial institution. Meanwhile, the financial institution is free to use the deposited cash as it sees fit -- typically by lending the money to other consumers so that it can earn a return to fund its operations and earn a profit.

A CBDC, on the other hand, would be a direct liability of the U.S. Government that must be honored at all times by the U.S. Government, in the same way as central bank money, most commonly experienced by consumers in the form of physical currency -- cash. This differs significantly from commercial bank money and nonbank money, both of which are subject to varying degrees of credit and liquidity risk because consumers are exchanging central bank money (cash) when they deposit it for a promise to repay from the commercial bank or nonbank. _See_ [_Money and Payments_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/money-and-payments-discussion-paper.htm) at 25 (Appendix B: Types of Money). This promise creates credit and liquidity risk for the consumer; if the bank or (and especially) nonbank folds, the consumer might not get repaid. A significant transfer of money from central banks and commercial banks to nonbank money could create significant risks in the financial system, because nonbank money is not, for example, subject to the [FDIC](https://www.thecod3x.com/fdic/) or NCUA insurance that serve to ward against destabilizing bank runs.

This is why the prospect of a CBDC was so intriguing during the 2020-2022 period of active exploration. It would enable the general public to hold central bank money, directly, with zero liquidity or credit risk. But what would this actually look like? According to the Fed, it should be "privacy-protected, intermediated, widely transferable, and identity-verified." [_Money and Payments_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/money-and-payments-discussion-paper.htm) at 13.

#### Privacy Protected <a href="#privacy-protected" id="privacy-protected"></a>

The Fed provides no guidance on what it envisions by a "privacy-protected" CBDC, offering only this limited statement: "Any CBDC would need to strike an appropriate balance, however, between safeguarding the privacy rights of consumers and affording the transparency necessary to deter criminal activity."

Reading between the lines, the Fed acknowledged a common concern: truly private digital payments that require no central clearing house could be a boon to criminals and their money laundering operations. But consumers also do not want the government to have instant access to every financial transaction they engage in. This tension between a digital currency that functions like cash and is backed by the Federal Reserve, the need for privacy, and the need to prevent bad actors from using money indiscriminately leads the Fed to recommend that a CBDC be intermediated -- i.e., mostly used through an intermediary. The intermediary would host digital wallets and, presumably, engage in anti-money laundering checks for owners of those wallets and transactions occurring in them through existing regulatory frameworks, including the Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act. _See_ [FinCEN](https://www.thecod3x.com/fincen/).

#### Transferable <a href="#transferable" id="transferable"></a>

The Fed stated that a CBDC must be "readily transferable between customers of different intermediaries." [_Money and Payments_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/money-and-payments-discussion-paper.htm) at 13. In other words, it must be as easy to exchange as cash, so that value does not get locked into an intermediary, creating a drag on the economy when considered on a large scale.

#### Identity-Verified <a href="#identity-verified" id="identity-verified"></a>

Confirming that the Fed anticipates intermediaries would conduct the robust anti-money laundering checks that financial institutions are required to perform, the Fed noted that "a CBDC intermediary would need to verify the identity of a person accessing CBDC, _just as banks and other financial institutions currently verify the identities of their customers_." (emphasis added). [_Money and Payments_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/money-and-payments-discussion-paper.htm) at 14. Thus any institution that planned to host a CBDC would need to fully comply with existing anti-money laundering and terrorism financing regulations, such as the Bank Secrecy Act, [31 U.S.C. ch. 53](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/subtitle-IV/chapter-53), and the USA PATRIOT Act.

### Project Hamilton <a href="#project-hamilton" id="project-hamilton"></a>

The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (Boston Fed), in conjunction with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Digital Currency Initiative (MIT DCI), conducted a multiyear research project "to explore the CBDC design space and gain a hands-on understanding of a CBDC's technical challenges and opportunities." Boston Fed & MIT DCI, [_Project Hamilton Phase 1: A High Performance Payment Processing System Designed for Central Bank Digital Currencies_](https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/one-time-pubs/project-hamilton-phase-1-executive-summary.aspx) (2022.02.03). On February 3, 2022, the Boston Fed and MIT DCI released the results of Phase 1 of their research, the primary goal of which "was to design a core transaction processor that meets the robust speed, throughput, and fault tolerance requirements of a large retail payment system." [_Id._](https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/one-time-pubs/project-hamilton-phase-1-executive-summary.aspx) at 3.

In banking, the "core system" or "core processor" is the name for the ledger system that keeps track of all transactions across accounts and the order in which they occur. In Project Hamilton, the Fed experimented with different design features for a new system to handle the use of digital currency, including different levels of identification for customers. Despite taking advantage of cryptographic keys and digital wallets, users would still interact with a "central transaction processor," which differs fundamentally from the distributed and decentralized ledgers of most cryptocurrency. [_Id._](https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/one-time-pubs/project-hamilton-phase-1-executive-summary.aspx) at 4. The Fed noted that "a distributed ledger does not match the trust assumptions in Project Hamilton's approach, which assumes that the platform would be administered by a central actor." [_Id._](https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/one-time-pubs/project-hamilton-phase-1-executive-summary.aspx) at 5. One of the two architectures tested achieved throughput of 1.7 million transactions per second -- approximately 1,000 times more transactions than Visa processes per second. _See, e.g._, Kenny Li, [_The Blockchain Scalability Problem & the Race for Visa-Like Transaction Speed_](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-blockchain-scalability-problem-the-race-for-visa-like-transaction-speed-5cce48f9d44), TowardsDataScience.com (2019.01.30).

On December 22, 2022, the Boston Fed and MIT announced the conclusion of Project Hamilton, stating they had met the goal of creating a core processing engine for a hypothetical general-purpose CBDC. Boston Fed, [_Project Hamilton Concludes_](https://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-events/news/2022/12/project-hamilton-boston-fed-mit-complete-central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc-project.aspx) (2022.12.22). The project wound down after completing its planned research, weeks after congressional legislators inquired about its status. The open-source OpenCBDC codebase remains publicly available on GitHub.

### Congressional and Political Debate <a href="#congressional-and-political-debate" id="congressional-and-political-debate"></a>

CBDC policy became increasingly politicized between 2022 and 2025. In May 2022, House Financial Services Committee Republicans wrote to the Fed expressing concerns about CBDC development, warning of threats to financial privacy and the existing banking system. _See_ Patrick McHenry & Ann Wagner, [_Letter Regarding Central Bank Digital Currencies_](https://republicans-financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/2022-05-18_fsc_gop_cbdc_letter.pdf) (2022.05.18). Within the Fed itself, Vice Chair Brainard was the Board's most vocal CBDC proponent, calling a digital dollar a "natural evolution" of the payment system. _See_ Vice Chair Lael Brainard, [_Digital Assets and the Future of Finance_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/brainard20220526a.htm) (2022.05.26). Her stance stood in direct contrast to Governor Waller, who repeatedly asked "What major market failure exists that only a retail CBDC can solve?" and called CBDC "a solution in search of a problem." Governor Christopher J. Waller, [_CBDC: A Solution in Search of a Problem?_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20210805a.htm) (2021.08.05); Governor Christopher J. Waller, [_The U.S. Dollar and Central Bank Digital Currencies_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20221014a.htm) (2022.10.14).

Brainard resigned on February 14, 2023, to serve as Director of the National Economic Council under President Biden, removing the Board's most prominent CBDC advocate and shifting the internal balance of opinion decisively toward skepticism. _See_ Federal Reserve Board, [_Press Release_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20230214a.htm) (2023.02.14).

Chair Powell's own position evolved in three stages. In June 2022, he told Congress the Fed planned to "come to Congress with a recommendation at some point." By March 2024, he told the Senate Banking Committee: "We're nowhere near recommending -- or let alone adopting -- a central bank digital currency in any form." By February 11, 2025, Powell definitively stated the Fed would "never" issue a CBDC while he leads the central bank and confirmed he would oppose any attempt to launch one.

### EO 14178: CBDC Prohibition (January 2025) <a href="#eo-14178-cbdc-prohibition" id="eo-14178-cbdc-prohibition"></a>

On January 23, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14178, "Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology," which explicitly prohibits federal agencies from undertaking any action to establish, issue, or promote CBDCs within the jurisdiction of the United States or abroad. Exec. Order No. 14178, [_Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology_](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/strengthening-american-leadership-in-digital-financial-technology/) (2025.01.23). The order requires that any ongoing plans or initiatives related to CBDC creation be "immediately terminated." The EO cites concerns that CBDCs threaten the stability of the financial system, individual privacy, and U.S. sovereignty, and favors private-sector innovations like dollar-backed stablecoins to reinforce the dollar's global dominance. _See_ [Executive Actions](https://www.thecod3x.com/exec/).

As of February 2026, all Federal Reserve CBDC research and development has been terminated pursuant to EO 14178. The Fed's CBDC webpage remains online but has not been substantively updated. The New York Fed's Innovation Center (NYIC) continues some wholesale payments research but has shifted focus away from CBDC toward tokenization and distributed ledger technology applications.

## Bank Supervision of Crypto Activities <a href="#bank-supervision-of-crypto-activities" id="bank-supervision-of-crypto-activities"></a>

### SR 22-6: Notification Requirement (August 2022) <a href="#sr-22-6-notification-requirement" id="sr-22-6-notification-requirement"></a>

On August 16, 2022, the Fed issued supervisory guidance requiring all Fed-supervised banking organizations -- including those with $10 billion or less in consolidated assets -- to notify their lead supervisory point of contact before engaging in any crypto-asset-related activity. The Fed, SR 22-6 / CA 22-6, [_Engagement in Crypto-Asset-Related Activities by Federal Reserve-Supervised Banking Organizations_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/SR2206.htm) (2022.08.16). Banks already engaged in crypto activities were required to notify the Fed promptly. Covered activities included crypto-asset safekeeping, traditional and ancillary custody services, facilitating customer purchases and sales, loans collateralized by crypto-assets, and issuance and distribution of stablecoins. Prior to engaging in any such activities, the Fed advised that supervised entities must be confident in the legality of the proposed activities and must "have in place adequate systems, risk management, and controls to conduct crypto-asset-related activities in a safe and sound manner and consistent with applicable laws." _Id._ SR 22-6 was withdrawn on April 24, 2025.

Days after issuing SR 22-6, the Fed published guidance regarding how financial firms with novel bank charters may gain access to Federal Reserve accounts. The Fed, [_Guidelines for Evaluating Account and Services Requests_](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/08/19/2022-17885/guidelines-for-evaluating-account-and-services-requests), 87 Fed. Reg. 51099 (2022.08.19).

### Interagency Joint Statements (2023) <a href="#interagency-joint-statements-2023" id="interagency-joint-statements-2023"></a>

On January 3, 2023, the Federal Reserve, [FDIC](https://www.thecod3x.com/fdic/), and [OCC](https://www.thecod3x.com/occ/) issued their first joint statement on crypto-asset risks to banking organizations. The Fed, FDIC, & OCC, [_Joint Statement on Crypto-Asset Risks to Banking Organizations_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20230103a.htm) (2023.01.03). Issued in the wake of major crypto platform failures (FTX, Celsius, Voyager, Terra/Luna), the statement identified key risks including fraud, legal uncertainties, misrepresentation, volatility, stablecoin run risk, contagion from interconnectedness, and lack of maturity in risk management practices. The agencies emphasized that "crypto-asset risks that cannot be mitigated or controlled should not migrate to the banking system."

On February 23, 2023, the three agencies issued a second joint statement specifically addressing liquidity risks from crypto-asset market vulnerabilities. The Fed, FDIC, & OCC, [_Joint Statement on Liquidity Risks to Banking Organizations Resulting from Crypto-Asset Market Vulnerabilities_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20230223a.htm) (2023.02.23). The statement highlighted the unpredictability of deposit inflows and outflows from crypto-asset-related entities, including deposits placed for the benefit of end customers and stablecoin-related reserves. It noted that factors such as customer behavior during market stress events, media reports, and uncertainty about deposit insurance coverage could drive rapid withdrawals and deposit volatility. Both joint statements were withdrawn on April 24, 2025.

### SR 23-7: Novel Activities Supervision Program (August 2023) <a href="#sr-23-7-novel-activities-supervision-program" id="sr-23-7-novel-activities-supervision-program"></a>

On August 8, 2023, the Federal Reserve established the Novel Activities Supervision Program (NASP) to monitor and examine novel activities conducted by supervised banking organizations. The Fed, SR 23-7, [_Creation of Novel Activities Supervision Program_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20230808a.htm) (2023.08.08). The program focused on three categories: (1) crypto-assets, (2) distributed ledger technology ("DLT"), and (3) complex, technology-driven partnerships with nonbanks to deliver financial services. The program was risk-based, with the level and intensity of supervision varying based on each bank's engagement level. Supervised entities were not moved to a separate supervisory portfolio but worked within existing teams. The program was advised by multidisciplinary leaders from across the Federal Reserve System. SR 23-7 was formally rescinded on August 15, 2025, when the Board sunset the NASP.

### SR 23-8: Dollar Token Nonobjection Process (August 2023) <a href="#sr-23-8-dollar-token-nonobjection-process" id="sr-23-8-dollar-token-nonobjection-process"></a>

Issued alongside SR 23-7 on August 8, 2023, SR 23-8 required state member banks to obtain written supervisory nonobjection from the Fed before engaging in "dollar token" activities -- defined to include stablecoins, tokenized deposits, and any digital representations of U.S. dollars on blockchain networks. The Fed, SR 23-8, [_Supervisory Nonobjection Process for State Member Banks Seeking to Engage in Certain Activities Involving Dollar Tokens_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20230808a.htm) (2023.08.08). Banks had to demonstrate appropriate risk management controls, and banks with pre-existing dollar token activities were required to notify the Fed by September 8, 2023. The letter aligned with [OCC](https://www.thecod3x.com/occ/) Interpretive Letter 1174 on permissible stablecoin activities for national banks. SR 23-8 was withdrawn on April 24, 2025.

### Guidance Withdrawal (April 2025) <a href="#guidance-withdrawal-april-2025" id="guidance-withdrawal-april-2025"></a>

On April 24, 2025, the Federal Reserve Board withdrew all key supervisory guidance from the Biden era that had constrained banks from engaging in digital asset activities. The Fed, [_Withdrawal of Guidance for Banks Related to Their Crypto-Asset and Dollar Token Activities_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20250424a.htm) (2025.04.24). Specifically, the Board rescinded SR 22-6 (the August 2022 notification requirement) and SR 23-8 (the dollar token nonobjection process) and joined the [OCC](https://www.thecod3x.com/occ/) and [FDIC](https://www.thecod3x.com/fdic/) in withdrawing the two 2023 joint statements. Going forward, the Board stated it would consider digital asset activities as part of its regular safety and soundness supervision. The three federal banking regulators are now aligned in no longer requiring banks to provide prior notice or receive nonobjection before engaging in crypto-asset activities. Governor Michael Barr dissented from the rescission. The agencies noted they were "exploring issuing additional clarity with respect to banking organizations' crypto-asset and related activities in the coming weeks and months."

On August 15, 2025, the Fed formally ended the Novel Activities Supervision Program and rescinded SR 23-7. The Fed, [_Sunset of Novel Activities Supervision Program_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20250815a.htm) (2025.08.15). The Board explained it had "strengthened its understanding" of these activities and would integrate the knowledge gained from the program into the standard supervisory process.

On December 17, 2025, the Board withdrew its 2023 policy statement and issued a new policy statement on permissible activities for state member banks. The Fed, [_Revised Policy Statement on Permissible Novel Activities_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20251217a.htm) (2025.12.17); 90 Fed. Reg. (2025.12.22). Key changes included: (1) removal of the rebuttable presumption that state member banks could only engage in activities permissible for national banks; (2) adoption of the principle that "different activity, different risks, different regulation"; (3) allowance for uninsured state member banks to engage in activities impermissible for insured banks under certain conditions; and (4) specific factors the Fed may consider including total loss-absorbing capacity, liquidity coverage, and resolution planning. Governor Barr dissented, warning that the "different activity, different risks, different regulation" principle would encourage regulatory arbitrage.

## 2023 Bank Failures <a href="#2023-bank-failures" id="2023-bank-failures"></a>

### Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature Bank <a href="#silvergate-svb-signature" id="silvergate-svb-signature"></a>

The March 2023 banking crisis eliminated three of the most significant banking partners for the cryptocurrency industry in rapid succession and triggered the most significant emergency actions by the Fed since the 2008 financial crisis.

**Silvergate Bank.** Silvergate Capital Corporation announced a "voluntary liquidation" of its banking subsidiary, Silvergate Bank, on March 8, 2023. Silvergate had been a central banking partner for the crypto industry, operating the Silvergate Exchange Network ("SEN") for real-time dollar transfers between crypto firms. The bank's collapse followed the FTX failure in November 2022, which triggered massive deposit withdrawals -- customer deposits fell 68% to $3.8 billion in Q4 2022. Silvergate reported a nearly $1 billion net loss in Q4 2022, laid off 40% of its workforce in January 2023, and delayed filing its annual 10-K report. Silvergate's regulators included the Federal Reserve and the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation ("DFPI"). By November 2023, all deposits had been repaid. In July 2024, Silvergate paid $63 million to settle enforcement actions with the SEC, Federal Reserve, and California DFPI for misleading statements about its anti-money laundering program.

**Silicon Valley Bank.** Silicon Valley Bank ("SVB"), the 16th-largest U.S. bank with approximately $209 billion in assets, failed on March 10, 2023, when the California DFPI closed the bank and appointed the [FDIC](https://www.thecod3x.com/fdic/) as receiver. SVB had concentrated exposure to technology and venture capital clients, including crypto firms. The bank experienced a classic bank run after announcing it had sold $21 billion in securities at a $1.8 billion loss and planned to raise $2.25 billion in capital. The failure was the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history.

**Signature Bank.** Signature Bank, a New York-based institution with approximately $110 billion in assets and significant crypto-industry clients, was closed by the New York State Department of Financial Services on March 12, 2023, citing systemic risk. The FDIC was appointed as receiver. Signature had been a major provider of banking services to crypto firms through its Signet real-time payments platform, with major crypto clients including Coinbase and Paxos. The closure triggered brief depegging of certain stablecoins.

**Systemic Risk Exception.** On March 12, 2023, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen invoked the systemic risk exception after receiving recommendations from the FDIC Board and Federal Reserve Board and consulting with the President. The Fed, [_Joint Statement by Treasury, Federal Reserve, and FDIC_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230312a.htm) (2023.03.12). This allowed the FDIC to protect all depositors of both SVB and Signature Bank, including uninsured depositors. The determination stated that any losses would be funded by a special assessment on banks, not taxpayers. The collective closure of Silvergate, SVB, and Signature disrupted critical payment infrastructure -- the SEN and Signet had been the primary real-time payment rails used by crypto firms to settle dollar transactions -- and many crypto companies struggled to find replacement banking relationships.

### Barr SVB Supervision Review (April 2023) <a href="#barr-svb-supervision-review" id="barr-svb-supervision-review"></a>

On March 13, 2023, Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr announced a review of the Fed's supervision and regulation of SVB. The Fed, [_Review of the Federal Reserve's Supervision and Regulation of Silicon Valley Bank_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/review-of-the-federal-reserves-supervision-and-regulation-of-silicon-valley-bank.htm) (2023.04.28). The 114-page report, published on April 28, 2023, found that SVB failed due to "a textbook case of mismanagement" combined with lax Fed supervision. Supervisors were slow to grasp the extent of SVB's problems -- particularly interest rate and liquidity risk -- and failed to act aggressively enough when issues were identified. The report also found that 2019 regulatory changes under the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, [Pub. L. No. 115-174](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/chapter-16), that exempted all but the largest banks from strict scrutiny, along with a cultural shift toward less-assertive supervision, allowed problems to fester. Barr committed to "strengthen the Federal Reserve's supervision and regulation."

### Bank Term Funding Program <a href="#bank-term-funding-program" id="bank-term-funding-program"></a>

On March 12, 2023, the Fed invoked its Section 13(3) emergency lending authority, [12 U.S.C. 343(3)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/343), to create the Bank Term Funding Program ("BTFP"). The Fed, [_Bank Term Funding Program_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/financial-stability/bank-term-funding-program.htm) (2023.03.12). The program offered loans of up to one year to eligible depository institutions, secured by U.S. Treasuries, agency securities, and agency mortgage-backed securities, valued at par (face value rather than market value). This was critical because many banks held securities with large unrealized losses due to rising interest rates. The BTFP was designed to prevent a broader bank run by ensuring institutions could meet depositor demands without crystallizing losses on their securities portfolios. The program ceased making new loans on March 11, 2024.

### "Operation Chokepoint 2.0" Allegations <a href="#operation-chokepoint-2-0" id="operation-chokepoint-2-0"></a>

The term "Operation Chokepoint 2.0" was adopted by critics of the Biden administration's crypto policy to describe what they alleged was a coordinated effort by federal regulators -- the Fed, [FDIC](https://www.thecod3x.com/fdic/), and [OCC](https://www.thecod3x.com/occ/) -- to restrict banking services for the cryptocurrency industry. The allegation centers on the combination of: (1) the January and February 2023 joint statements warning about crypto risks; (2) SR 22-6 and SR 23-7/SR 23-8 notification and nonobjection requirements; (3) FDIC "pause letters" sent to banks considering crypto activities; and (4) the closures of Silvergate, SVB, and Signature Bank. A November 30, 2025 House Financial Services Committee report documented evidence that at least 30 digital asset entities and individuals lost banking access between 2022 and 2024. House Financial Services Committee, [_Debanking Report_](https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/2025-11-30_--_fsc_debanking_report_final.pdf) (2025.11.30). Internal FDIC documents obtained through FOIA revealed supervisory communications discouraging banks from serving crypto clients. Chair Powell acknowledged in his February 11, 2025 testimony that the Fed was "looking into" claims of widespread debanking, though he stopped short of confirming political motivation. The April 24, 2025 withdrawal of all crypto guidance was widely viewed as the end of "Operation Chokepoint 2.0."

## Custodia Bank <a href="#custodia-bank" id="custodia-bank"></a>

### Master Account Application and Denial <a href="#custodia-master-account" id="custodia-master-account"></a>

Custodia Bank, Inc. (formerly Avanti Financial Group, Inc.), founded by Caitlin Long, holds a Special Purpose Depository Institution ("SPDI") charter from the State of Wyoming. The SPDI charter allows Custodia to take deposits but does not require FDIC insurance. Custodia's business model focuses on providing banking services to cryptocurrency companies, including plans to issue a dollar-pegged token on a public blockchain.

In October 2020, Custodia applied for a master account at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, which would provide direct access to Federal Reserve payment services including Fedwire. Separately, in August 2021, Custodia applied for membership in the Federal Reserve System. After nearly two years without a decision, Custodia filed suit on June 7, 2022 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Wyoming, alleging "unlawful delay" by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. _See, e.g._, James Rubin, [_Crypto Bank Custodia Sues Federal Reserve_](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/07/crypto-bank-custodia-sues-federal-reserve/) (2022.06.07); [_Custodia Bank Inc v. Federal Reserve Board of Governors_](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/63366375/custodia-bank-inc-v-federal-reserve-board-of-governors/?order_by=desc), No. 22-cv-00125 (D. Wyo. June 7, 2022).

On January 27, 2023, both the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City denied Custodia's applications. The Fed, [_Order Denying Custodia Bank Membership Application_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/orders20230127a.htm) (2023.01.27). The Board denied the membership application, and the Kansas City Fed denied the master account application. The Board cited "significant safety and soundness risks" from Custodia's "novel and untested crypto activities," including its plan to issue a crypto asset on "open, public, and/or decentralized networks." The Board characterized Custodia's business model as "unprecedented" and "focus[ed] almost exclusively on offering products and services related to novel crypto-asset activities."

### Litigation <a href="#custodia-litigation" id="custodia-litigation"></a>

On March 29, 2024, Judge Scott Skavdahl of the U.S. District Court for the District of Wyoming ruled against Custodia on all claims. The court held that federal law does not require the Federal Reserve to grant every eligible depository institution access to a master account. Neither the Federal Reserve Act nor the Monetary Control Act creates a mandatory entitlement to master account access; rather, both grant Federal Reserve Banks discretion in approving or denying applications.

On October 31, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the district court's judgment in favor of the Fed on all claims. _Custodia Bank, Inc. v. Federal Reserve Board of Governors_, No. 24-8024 (10th Cir. Oct. 31, 2025), [_available at_](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca10/24-8024/24-8024-2025-10-31.html). The appellate court held that the plain language of the Federal Reserve Act and the Monetary Control Act grants Federal Reserve Banks discretion to approve or deny master account applications from eligible entities. Neither statute mandates automatic access for all qualifying institutions. The decision is significant because it established that Federal Reserve Banks have discretion over master account applications -- a precedent that affects all nontraditional banking charter applicants. As of February 2026, Custodia has the option to petition for rehearing en banc and has indicated it is considering that path. The December 17, 2025 revised Fed policy statement on novel activities for state member banks may be more receptive to uninsured state banks engaged in crypto-asset activities, potentially affecting future applications similar to Custodia's.

## FedNow Service <a href="#fednow-service" id="fednow-service"></a>

### Launch and Adoption <a href="#fednow-launch-and-adoption" id="fednow-launch-and-adoption"></a>

On July 20, 2023, the Federal Reserve officially launched the FedNow Service, enabling participating financial institutions to send and receive instant payments 24/7/365, with recipients having full access to funds immediately. The Fed, [_FedNow Service Launch Announcement_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20230315a.htm) (2023.03.15) (announcing July launch date). At launch, 35 banks and credit unions were participating, with early adopters including JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo.

Adoption of FedNow grew rapidly. By the end of 2024, over 1,000 financial institutions had enrolled. By January 2025, the number exceeded 1,200. By October 2025, over 1,500 financial institutions headquartered in all 50 states were participating. _See_ FRB Services, [_FedNow Service: Two Years of Growth and Innovation_](https://www.frbservices.org/news/fed360/issues/071625/fednow-service-two-years-growth-innovation) (2025.07.16). Small and midsize financial institutions -- community banks and credit unions -- make up over 95% of participants. Transaction volume grew 1,200% year-over-year, from 97,424 settled payments in Q1 2024 to 1,310,017 in Q1 2025. Q2 2025 processed $245 billion, up from $492 million in Q2 2024 -- approximately 49,000% year-over-year growth. Over 35 certified service providers support payment processing through the system.

### Relationship to Stablecoin Payment Systems <a href="#fednow-stablecoin-relationship" id="fednow-stablecoin-relationship"></a>

The Federal Reserve has been explicit that FedNow is separate from digital assets and CBDCs. In a July 2023 FAQ, the Fed stated: "The FedNow Service is not related to a digital currency." Industry analysts have debated whether FedNow reduces the use case for stablecoin-based consumer payments by providing cost-reduction and settlement-speed benefits without requiring token conversion. FedNow operates on traditional financial rails, not blockchain, and requires bank intermediation.

FedNow's availability has also strengthened the argument against a retail CBDC. Governor Bowman explicitly cited FedNow in an October 17, 2023 speech at Harvard Law School, suggesting that existing payment improvements might offer more efficient solutions than a CBDC. Governor Michelle W. Bowman, [_Responsible Innovation in Money and Payments_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20231017a.htm) (2023.10.17). Governor Waller has similarly argued that private-sector innovations and Fed infrastructure like FedNow reduce the case for a government-issued digital currency.

## Stablecoin Policy Under the GENIUS Act <a href="#stablecoin-policy-genius-act" id="stablecoin-policy-genius-act"></a>

### Fed's Oversight Role <a href="#fed-oversight-role" id="fed-oversight-role"></a>

The GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act), signed into law on July 18, 2025, established the first comprehensive federal regulatory framework for payment stablecoins. GENIUS Act, [Pub. L. No. 119-XX](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/1582/text) (2025). For a full analysis of the Act's provisions, _see_ [Treasury](https://www.thecod3x.com/treasury/) and [FSOC](https://www.thecod3x.com/fsoc/). The Fed's specific roles under the Act include:

* **Stablecoin Certification Review Committee (SCRC).** The Fed sits alongside the [Treasury](https://www.thecod3x.com/treasury/) (as chair) and the [FDIC](https://www.thecod3x.com/fdic/) on the SCRC, which must unanimously approve or deny state applications for certification that a state regulatory framework is "substantially similar" to the federal standard, within 30 days.
* **Oversight of Bank-Issued Stablecoins.** For insured depository institution ("IDI") subsidiaries that issue payment stablecoins, the Fed serves as a federal banking agency with supervisory authority, consistent with its existing role as the primary federal regulator for state member banks and bank holding companies.
* **Implementation.** The Fed published a Federal Register notice on September 19, 2025 regarding GENIUS Act implementation. _See_ 90 Fed. Reg. (2025.09.19).

Under the GENIUS Act, any issuer of payment stablecoins must hold high-quality, liquid reserve assets backed at least 1:1. Permissible reserve assets are limited to: (1) U.S. cash and currency, (2) balances held at a Federal Reserve Bank, (3) demand deposits at an insured depository institution, and (4) short-term U.S. Treasury bills, notes, or bonds with remaining maturity of 93 days or less. Issuers must make monthly public disclosures of reserve composition. The reserve framework is designed to prevent the type of run risk observed in the March 2023 banking crisis and the Terra/UST collapse of May 2022. The Act explicitly subjects all payment stablecoin issuers to the Bank Secrecy Act (AML/CFT requirements). _See_ [FinCEN](https://www.thecod3x.com/fincen/).

### Waller's "Skinny Master Account" Proposal <a href="#waller-skinny-master-account" id="waller-skinny-master-account"></a>

On October 21, 2025, Governor Waller proposed creating a limited-feature "skinny master account" (formally, a "payment account") to provide payments innovators -- potentially including stablecoin issuers -- with direct access to Federal Reserve payment rails (Fedwire and FedNow). Governor Christopher J. Waller, [_Opening Remarks at the Payments Innovation Conference_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20251021a.htm) (2025.10.21). Key restrictions would include: no interest on balances, possible balance caps, no daylight overdraft privileges (payments rejected if balance hits zero), no discount window access, and no access to services where the Fed cannot control overdraft risk. The accounts would be available to all legally eligible institutions and subject to a "streamlined" review timeline with lower scrutiny than required for full master accounts. The proposal is widely viewed as a potential solution to the Custodia-type access question and a means to integrate stablecoin issuers into the regulated payment system. The Fed subsequently released a Request for Information on the prototype concept.

## Leadership <a href="#leadership" id="leadership"></a>

### Chair Powell <a href="#chair-powell" id="chair-powell"></a>

Jerome H. Powell was confirmed by the Senate on May 12, 2022 for his second term as Chair, sworn in on May 23, 2022. His Chair term expires May 15, 2026; his Board term expires January 31, 2028. On digital assets, Powell's stance evolved from cautious engagement in 2022 to firm CBDC rejection by 2025. He has been supportive of stablecoin regulation, stating on February 11, 2025 that "stablecoins may have a big future with consumers and businesses" and endorsing a regulatory framework. He acknowledged debanking concerns and committed to investigating them. On January 30, 2026, President Trump nominated Kevin Warsh -- a former Fed governor (2006-2011) -- to succeed Powell as Chair. Warsh faces Senate confirmation and, if confirmed, would assume the role when Powell's Chair term expires in May 2026. _See_ Federal Reserve Board, [_Press Release_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20220523e.htm) (2022.05.23).

### Vice Chair for Supervision Barr (2022-2025) <a href="#vice-chair-barr" id="vice-chair-barr"></a>

Michael S. Barr was confirmed by the Senate on July 13, 2022 and took office as Vice Chair for Supervision on July 19, 2022. He stepped down from the Vice Chair for Supervision role on February 28, 2025 to avoid a potential legal conflict with the incoming Trump administration, but retained his seat as a governor. Federal Reserve Board, [_Press Release_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20250106a.htm) (2025.01.06). During his tenure, Barr led the Fed's crypto and novel activities supervision framework: he established the Novel Activities Supervision Program, oversaw the SVB failure review, and advocated for stablecoin legislation with a strong Fed role. In his dissent from the April 2025 guidance withdrawal, he warned against the "different activity, different risks, different regulation" principle. _See_ Vice Chair Michael S. Barr, [_Managing the Promise and Risk of Financial Innovation_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20221012a.htm) (2022.10.12).

### Vice Chair for Supervision Bowman (2025-present) <a href="#vice-chair-bowman" id="vice-chair-bowman"></a>

Michelle W. Bowman, who had served as a Fed governor since 2018, was nominated by President Trump on March 17, 2025 for the Vice Chair for Supervision position. She was confirmed by the Senate on June 4, 2025 (48-46) and sworn in on June 9, 2025. Her Vice Chair term expires June 9, 2029; her Board term expires January 31, 2034. As Vice Chair for Supervision, Bowman has signaled a distinctly more innovation-friendly approach. Her August 19, 2025 speech at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium urged regulators to "depart from an overly cautious mindset" and proposed that "Federal Reserve staff should hold de minimis amounts of crypto or other types of digital assets so they can achieve a working understanding of the underlying functionality." Governor Michelle W. Bowman, [_Embracing Innovation_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250819a.htm) (2025.08.19). She oversaw the sunset of the Novel Activities Supervision Program and the revised December 2025 policy statement. _See_ Federal Reserve Board, [_Press Release_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20250609a.htm) (2025.06.09).

### Governor Waller <a href="#governor-waller" id="governor-waller"></a>

Christopher J. Waller has been the most influential Fed voice on stablecoins and digital assets from 2022 through 2026. He is the Board's leading CBDC skeptic and strongest stablecoin advocate, arguing that well-regulated stablecoins can "maintain and extend the role of the dollar internationally." His February 12, 2025 speech at "A Very Stable Conference" in San Francisco endorsed stablecoins as an important innovation. Governor Christopher J. Waller, [_Remarks at "A Very Stable Conference"_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250212a.htm) (2025.02.12). His August 20, 2025 speech at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium called stablecoins a "payments revolution" and stated "there is nothing scary about DeFi simply because it operates outside traditional banking." Governor Christopher J. Waller, [_Remarks at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250820a.htm) (2025.08.20). In October 2025, he introduced the "skinny master account" proposal for payments innovators.

### Vice Chair Brainard (departure 2023) <a href="#vice-chair-brainard" id="vice-chair-brainard"></a>

Lael Brainard was the Fed's most prominent CBDC advocate during 2021-2023, calling a digital dollar a "natural evolution" of the payment system and emphasizing its potential benefits for financial inclusion and maintaining the dollar's global competitiveness. She resigned on February 14, 2023 (effective approximately February 20, 2023) to serve as Director of the National Economic Council under President Biden. Her departure removed the Board's strongest CBDC voice and shifted the internal balance decisively toward skeptics. _See_ Vice Chair Lael Brainard, [_Digital Assets and the Future of Finance_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/brainard20220526a.htm) (2022.05.26); Federal Reserve Board, [_Press Release_](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20230214a.htm) (2023.02.14).

## International Coordination <a href="#international-coordination" id="international-coordination"></a>

### Basel Committee Crypto-Asset Standards <a href="#basel-committee" id="basel-committee"></a>

In December 2022, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ("BCBS") published its final prudential standard for banks' exposures to cryptoassets, endorsed by the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision ("GHOS"). BCBS, [_Prudential Treatment of Cryptoasset Exposures_](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d545.htm) (2022.12). The standard establishes a two-group classification: Group 1 (tokenized traditional assets and stablecoins meeting specific criteria, receiving preferential capital treatment) and Group 2 (unbacked cryptoassets and stablecoins failing the criteria, receiving a 1,250% risk weight). In December 2023, the Committee consulted on targeted revisions to tighten the criteria for stablecoins to receive preferential Group 1b treatment. BCBS, [_Consultation on Targeted Revisions_](https://www.bis.org/press/p231214.htm) (2023.12.14). In July 2024, the Committee published the final revised cryptoasset standard with targeted amendments and a standardized disclosure framework. BCBS, [_Final Revised Cryptoasset Standard_](https://www.bis.org/press/p240717.htm) (2024.07.17). The GHOS deferred implementation by one year to January 1, 2026. As of February 2026, jurisdictions including Canada and Hong Kong are on track for implementation. The Federal Reserve has not finalized a domestic rule implementing the Basel cryptoasset standard for U.S. banks.

### BIS Innovation Hub <a href="#bis-innovation-hub" id="bis-innovation-hub"></a>

The New York Innovation Center ("NYIC"), launched in November 2021, is a collaborative effort between the Federal Reserve Board, the New York Fed, and the BIS Innovation Hub. _See_ New York Fed, [_About the NYIC_](https://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/nyic). The NYIC has led or participated in several digital currency and payments innovation projects:

* **Project Cedar (2022-2023):** Explored how DLT could improve cross-border wholesale payments. Phase I, completed on November 4, 2022, demonstrated that DLT-based foreign exchange spot settlements could complete in under 10 seconds, compared to the traditional two-day settlement period. _See_ New York Fed, [_Project Cedar_](https://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/nyic/project-cedar).
* **Project Cedar Phase II x Ubin+ (2023):** A collaboration with the Monetary Authority of Singapore examining whether DLT could improve the efficiency of cross-border multi-currency payments and settlements.
* **Project Pine (2024):** A joint study with the BIS Innovation Hub exploring whether and how central banks could continue to implement monetary policy operations in hypothetical tokenized wholesale financial markets.

### FSB Stablecoin Recommendations <a href="#fsb-stablecoin-recommendations" id="fsb-stablecoin-recommendations"></a>

In July 2023, the Financial Stability Board ("FSB") published its final global regulatory framework for crypto-asset activities and global stablecoin arrangements. FSB, [_High-level Recommendations for the Regulation, Supervision and Oversight of Crypto-asset Activities and Markets_](https://www.fsb.org/2023/07/high-level-recommendations-for-the-regulation-supervision-and-oversight-of-crypto-asset-activities-and-markets-final-report/) (2023.07); FSB, [_High-level Recommendations for Global Stablecoin Arrangements_](https://www.fsb.org/2023/07/high-level-recommendations-for-the-regulation-supervision-and-oversight-of-global-stablecoin-arrangements-final-report/) (2023.07). The framework was endorsed at the G20 Leaders' Summit in New Delhi in September 2023. Key recommendations include "same activity, same risk, same regulation" principles; comprehensive governance, risk management, and disclosure requirements; and cross-border cooperation frameworks. The Fed participated in these deliberations as an FSB member. In October 2025, the FSB's thematic peer review found that jurisdictions had made progress in regulating crypto-asset activities but that "significant gaps and inconsistencies remain" across member jurisdictions. FSB, [_Thematic Review on the Global Regulatory Framework for Crypto-Asset Activities_](https://www.fsb.org/2025/10/thematic-review-on-fsb-global-regulatory-framework-for-crypto-asset-activities/) (2025.10). The BIS Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures ("CPMI") published a separate report in October 2023 examining the potential role of stablecoin arrangements in cross-border payments. CPMI, [_Considerations for the Use of Stablecoin Arrangements in Cross-Border Payments_](https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d220.pdf) (2023.10).

One of the central functions of banks in the financial system is to provide credit by taking in deposits and then lending out a significant portion of those deposits to consumers and businesses. If a CBDC or a large-scale stablecoin system were poorly designed, it could trigger substantial deposit outflows to nonbank intermediaries or to consumers' digital wallets. If those nonbank intermediaries do not issue loans, the credit available to the general public could dramatically decline. _See, e.g._, Carapella & Flemming, _supra_. Fed research has increasingly focused on this disintermediation risk in the context of stablecoins rather than CBDCs, as the policy debate has shifted accordingly. _See_ Wang, _supra_ (2025.12.17) (examining stablecoin implications for bank deposits and credit).
