# 1.24 - Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)

## Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

The Office of Foreign Asset Control is a component of the Department of the Treasury, and operates under the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. It implements, administers, and enforces sanctions issued to protect U.S. national security and foreign policy. In carrying out that mission, it can impose penalties and fines, freeze assets, and bar parties from operating in the United States. It can also make referrals to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution.

It is perhaps most well known among financial services firms for maintaining the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List) that provides a complete list of individuals, entities, and nations with whom it is illegal to transact, designations which it is permitted to make — and which carry the force of law — pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), [50 U.S.C. §§ 1701–06](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1701), or the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA), [50 U.S.C. §§ 4301–41](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/4301), and more recently, [Executive Order 13694](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/04/02/2015-07788/blocking-the-property-of-certain-persons-engaging-in-significant-malicious-cyber-enabled-activities), as amended by [Executive Order 13757](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/03/2016-31922/taking-additional-steps-to-address-the-national-emergency-with-respect-to-significant-malicious).

Although perhaps lesser known than agencies like the [SEC](https://www.thecod3x.com/sec/), [CFTC](https://www.thecod3x.com/cftc/), or [FinCEN](https://www.thecod3x.com/fincen/), OFAC has become one of the most consequential federal actors in the digital asset space. Its 2022 sanctioning of the Tornado Cash mixer protocol — and the landmark Fifth Circuit decision in _Van Loon v. Department of the Treasury_ (2024) holding that immutable smart contracts are not "property" subject to OFAC designation — have reshaped the legal boundaries of sanctions authority over decentralized technology. Alongside this, OFAC has levied the largest sanctions settlement in history against a cryptocurrency exchange (Binance, $968 million), expanded designations against state-sponsored crypto threats from North Korea, Russia, Iran, and Hamas, and navigated a shifting policy environment under [Executive Order 14178](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/strengthening-american-leadership-in-digital-financial-technology/) (January 2025). Understanding OFAC's role in the financial infrastructure of the United States is critical for crypto industry players who do business internationally to any extent or who have customer accounts that may attempt to interact with individuals or entities identified on OFAC's SDN list.

## Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN) <a href="#specially-designated-nationals-and-blocked-persons-list-sdn" id="specially-designated-nationals-and-blocked-persons-list-sdn"></a>

The SDN List is the comprehensive list of all individuals, entities, geographic regions, and countries that OFAC has designated as actors with which U.S. persons may not transact with for any reason. Designation on the list also extends the prohibition to entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, 50% or more by blocked persons. Once OFAC has made the designation, it is immediately illegal to make any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any blocked person or entity or to receive any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.

Violations of these prohibitions come with strict liability — it does not matter if an individual intends to violate the sanctions or is even aware of them. The simple act of carrying out a transaction with a blocked person or entity potentially carries significant civil fines and criminal penalties. _See_ [50 U.S.C. § 1705](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1705). It is thus absolutely critical for digital asset businesses to understand how these sanctions work and to have a plan for complying with them to avoid crushing fines and penalties, potentially levied not just against the business but against individual executives directly.

### Virtual Currency Addresses <a href="#virtual-currency-addresses" id="virtual-currency-addresses"></a>

OFAC began its focus on designating terrorist and criminal enterprises engaged in virtual currency activity in late 2018. Those efforts began by targeting specific virtual currency addresses and creators of cryptocurrencies blatantly used for criminal purposes:

* Designating two Iranian individuals who helped launder funds through the SamSam ransomware and their associated bitcoin addresses. OFAC, Press Release, [Treasury Designates Iran-Based Financial Facilitators of Malicious Cyber Activity and for the First Time Identifies Associated Digital Currency Addresses](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm556) (2018.11.28)
* Designating two North Korean individuals and their bitcoin addresses associated with the Lazarus Group involved in hacking multiple cryptocurrency exchanges. OFAC, [Treasury Sanctions Individuals Laundering Cryptocurrency for Lazarus Group](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm924) (2020.03.02)
* Designating a Chinese individual who launched cryptocurrencies to further criminal enterprises across Southeast Asia. OFAC, [Treasury Sanctions Corrupt Actors in Africa and Asia](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1206) (2020.12.09)
* Designating ten individuals and two entities associated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and associated bitcoin addresses, for their role in ransomware attacks. OFAC, Press Release, [Treasury Sanctions IRGC-Affiliated Cyber Actors for Roles in Ransomware Activity](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0948) (2022.09.14)
* Designating two over-the-counter (OTC) virtual currency traders who facilitated the conversion of stolen virtual currency to fiat currency for DPRK actors working with the Lazarus Group. OFAC, Press Release, [Treasury Targets DPRK Revenue-Generation and Missile-Procurement Networks](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1413) (2023.04.24)
* Designating two Chinese nationals involved in laundering stolen cryptocurrency from a 2018 cyber intrusion against a cryptocurrency exchange linked to the Lazarus Group. OFAC, Press Release, [Treasury Sanctions Actors Involved in Laundering Cryptocurrency for the Lazarus Group](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2752) (2024)
* Designating members of DPRK IT worker networks that fraudulently obtain remote employment to generate cryptocurrency revenue funneled to the regime's weapons programs, including Russian national Vitaliy Sergeyevich Andreyev, DPRK national Kim Ung Sun, and Chinese front company Shenyang Geumpungri Network Technology Co., Ltd. OFAC, Press Release, [Treasury Targets DPRK Revenue-Generation Networks](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0190) (2025.08.27)
* Designating eight individuals and two entities for laundering funds from DPRK cybercrime and IT worker fraud, including North Korean bankers Jang Kuk Chol and Ho Jong Son, who managed $5.3 million in cryptocurrency on behalf of OFAC-designated First Credit Bank. OFAC, Press Release, [Treasury Targets DPRK Revenue-Generation and Money Laundering Networks](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0302) (2025.11.04)

### Specific Entities / Markets <a href="#specific-entities-markets" id="specific-entities-markets"></a>

OFAC then expanded from individual actors/addresses to entire cryptocurrency enterprises:

* Designating SUEX OTC, a virtual currency exchange, that OFAC found had been involved in laundering eight different ransomware schemes, which resulted in over 40% of SUEX's known transaction history to be associated with illicit actors. OFAC, Press Release, [Treasury Takes Robust Actions to Counter Ransomware](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0364) (2021.09.21)
* Designating the darknet market Hydra and 100 associated virtual currency addresses, as well as virtual currency exchange Garantex, both operating out of Russia. OFAC, Press Release, [Treasury Sanctions Russia-Based Hydra, World's Largest Darknet Market, and Ransomware-Enabling Virtual Currency Exchange Garantex](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0701) (2022.04.05)
* Re-designating Garantex pursuant to E.O. 13694 (cybercrime authorities) after the original exchange's infrastructure was seized by the U.S. Secret Service, German, and Finnish law enforcement in March 2025. OFAC also designated Garantex's successor, Grinex, and took action against three executives and six associated companies in Russia and the Kyrgyz Republic. OFAC, Press Release, [Treasury Sanctions Garantex and Successor Grinex for Facilitating Cybercriminals](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0225) (2025.08.14)
* Designating Russia-based cryptocurrency exchange Cryptex — registered in St. Vincent and the Grenadines but operating in Russia — which had processed over $5.88 billion since 2018 and laundered over $51 million linked to ransomware attacks. OFAC also designated Sergey Sergeevich Ivanov for facilitating money laundering for fraud shops and darknet markets. OFAC, Press Release, [Treasury Targets Russian Cryptocurrency Exchange and Money Laundering Network](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2616) (2024.09.26)
* Designating 13 entities and 2 individuals for building or operating blockchain-based services facilitating sanctions evasion for Russian nationals, including Netex24/Netexchange, Bitpapa IC FZC LLC, and AWEX (Crypto Explorer DMCC). OFAC, Press Release, [Treasury Sanctions Entities in Russia's Virtual Currency Mining and Sanctions Evasion Network](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2204) (2024.03.25)
* Designating two UK-registered cryptocurrency exchanges, Zedcex Exchange Ltd. and Zedxion Exchange Ltd., for operating in Iran's financial sector and processing cryptocurrency transactions for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). This marked the first time OFAC designated digital asset exchanges specifically for operating in the financial sector of the Iranian economy. Zedcex had reportedly processed over $94 billion in transactions since its registration in August 2022, with approximately $1 billion in IRGC-related transactions conducted primarily through Tether (USDT) on the Tron network. The exchanges were linked to Iranian businessman Babak Morteza Zanjani, previously sentenced to death for embezzling billions from Iran's National Oil Company.

### Virtual Currency Mixers <a href="#virtual-currency-mixers" id="virtual-currency-mixers"></a>

More recently, the efforts have increased significantly in intensity by sanctioning not just particular entities or virtual wallet addresses, but protocols known as virtual currency mixers. The mixers are designed to allow transactions to occur anonymously on public blockchains by obscuring the origin and destination of particular amounts of funds. While stemming from the same goals as all of OFAC's other actions, these more recent actions pose vexing questions, including constitutional questions.‌

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Blender.io-flowchart-1.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### Blender.io <a href="#blender-io" id="blender-io"></a>

The first sanctioned mixer was Blender.io, a mixer operating on the bitcoin blockchain. OFAC, Press Release, [U.S. Treasury Issues First-Ever Sanctions on a Virtual Currency Mixer, Targets DPRK Cyber Threats](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0768) (2022.05.06). OFAC found that Blender.io had helped transfer more than $500 million worth of bitcoin since the protocol was created in 2017, and played a critical role in helping the North Korean-sponsored Lazarus Group process over $20.5 million in proceeds from the Axie Infinity hack.

This initial move by OFAC drew little objection from most observers, perhaps because Blender.io was a custodied protocol with central control. Thus sanctioning of the software was a proxy for the custodians who (presumably) refused to cooperate in changing the protocol to achieve compliance.

#### Tornado Cash <a href="#tornado-cash" id="tornado-cash"></a>

Three months later, OFAC sanctioned Tornado Cash, a highly popular decentralized currency mixer protocol operating on the Ethereum blockchain. OFAC, Press Release, [U.S. Treasury Sanctions Notorious Virtual Currency Mixer Tornado Cash](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916) (2022.08.08); OFAC, Press Release, [Treasury Designates DPRK Weapons Representatives](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1087) (2022.11.08) (re-designating Tornado Cash with clarifying FAQ 1095, see below). The rationale behind this sanction was similar; OFAC concluded the mixer had "been used to launder more than $7 billion worth of virtual currency since its creation in 2019" which included "$455 million stolen by the Lazarus Group," "$96 million of . . . funds derived from the June 24, 2022 Harmony Bridge Heist, and at least $7.8 million from the August 2, 2022 Nomad Heist."

This sanction proved to be far more controversial, although not for a reason acknowledged by OFAC itself in its press release. Almost immediately, industry groups protested the sanction as an attack on decentralized protocols generally, which are not controlled by any one person or entity. Hailey Lennon commented:

> OFAC merely identified a URL and a series of Ethereum contract addresses. Sanctioning a tool and noncustodial smart contract address that are not a direct alias of any person meriting sanction is substantively different from typical usage of the SDN list," and appeared to fail to acknowledge Treasury's own "clear guidance \[via FinCEN] in 2019 \[that] stressed the important difference a custodial wallet (hosted) and a noncustodial wallet (unhosted).

Hailey Lennon, [_Treasury Sanctions Against Major Crypto Privacy Tool Pose New Risks to the Industry_](https://www.forbes.com/sites/haileylennon/2022/08/09/treasury-sanctions-against-major-crypto-privacy-tool-pose-new-risks-to-the-industry/?sh=4a04bd834658) (2022.08.09).

Expanding on that point, Coin Center argued:

> If a contract is credibly decentralized then the original authors of that contract could be hit by a bus and the service would continue to work. As such, today's action does not seem so much a sanction against a person or entity with agency. It appears, instead, to be the sanctioning of a tool that is neutral in character and that can be put to good or bad uses like any other technology. . . . It is a ban on a technology and not a sanction against a person.

Jerry Brito & Peter Van Valkenburgh, [_U.S. Treasury sanction of privacy tools places sweeping restrictions on all Americans_](https://www.coincenter.org/u-s-treasury-sanction-of-privacy-tools-places-sweeping-restrictions-on-all-americans/) (2022.08.08). They noted that restrictions on the ability to use a neutral tool for purposes of spending money may involve significant First Amendment concerns.

As others have noted, if there are not legitimate tools in place to spend money anonymously, this could stifle meritorious free speech, access to medical services like abortion, or otherwise legal businesses that bear a social stigma like pornography. As crypto adoption accelerates, solving the balance between privacy and national security will become more critical.

Chainalysis also noted that despite the significant sums, stolen funds made up only 10.5% of the cryptocurrency moved through Tornado Cash. Chainalysis, [_OFAC Sanctions Popular Ethereum Mixer Tornado Cash for Laundering Crypto Stolen by North Korea's Lazarus Group_](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/tornado-cash-ofac-designation-sanctions/) (2022.08.08).

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/chainalysis-tornado-cash-1.jpeg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The move by OFAC to sanction the decentralized protocol thus appears to cut off nearly 90% of legitimate funds being moved through an anonymizing tool. In apparent protest of the sanction, one anonymous Twitter user claimed to be sending small amounts of ETH to hundreds of high profile wallets like Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and TV host Jimmy Fallon in a practice that became known as "dusting."

On September 13, 2022, OFAC released [a set of additional FAQs](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/faqs/added/2022-09-13) (see [below](ofac.md#tornado-cash)) to address some of the issues raised by sanctioning the Tornado Cash addresses. Those FAQs left open certain issues, including what exactly OFAC defines as "Toranado Cash," which it writes about as though it is an entity controlled by individuals. There are problems with thinking of Tornado Cash in those terms, as Alex Wade, Michael Lewellen, and Peter Van Valkenburgh of Coin Center have explained in their article [_How does Tornado Cash work?_](https://www.coincenter.org/education/advanced-topics/how-does-tornado-cash-work/)

The FAQs further leave open what exactly OFAC considers a "transaction" with the Tornado Cash addresses (i.e., is validating/mining a block with transactions in it also a prohibited transaction itself?) and how that definition may impact the base layer of blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. But they do clarify that simply publishing the source code for Tornado Cash is not prohibited, nor would be "discussing, teaching about, or including open-source code in written publications, such as textbooks, absent additional facts." _See_ [FAQ 1076](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/faqs/1076) and [1077](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/faqs/1077).

[FAQ 1078](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/faqs/1078) addresses the "dusting" issue above, but takes the position that sanctions compliance is still required of individuals who were "dusted," although OFAC clarifies enforcement against these individuals will not be a priority. Compliance for dusted individuals is thus technically still necessary for the foreseeable future.

[FAQ 1079](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/faqs/1079) does, however, provide a clear path for individuals with assets currently stuck in Tornado Cash to obtain a license from OFAC to withdraw those assets, provided they share with OFAC "all relevant information regarding these transactions with Tornado Cash, including the wallet addresses for the remitter and beneficiary, transaction hashes, the date and time of the transaction(s), as well as the amount(s) of virtual currency." If those conditions are met, OFAC opines that it will "have a favorable licensing policy towards such applications."

On November 8, 2022, OFAC simultaneously removed the Tornado Cash designation and re-designated it, largely with the same Ethereum addresses, and released an additional FAQ. OFAC, Press Release, [Treasury Designates DPRK Weapons Representatives](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1087) (2022.11.08) (re-designating Tornado Cash with clarifying FAQ 1095, see [below](ofac.md#tornado-cash)). The additional FAQ defines what person or entity specifically had been sanctioned, an apparent indirect response to Coin Center's lawsuit against Treasury challenging OFAC's sanctioning of immutable smart code contract code and not against an actual entity. _See_ [_Coin Center v. Yellen_](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/65418276/coin-center-v-yellen/)_,_ 22-cv-20375 (N.D. Fla. 2022) (Court Listener). The [FAQ](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/faqs/1095) clarifies that the sanctions are levied against the

> entity known as Tornado Cash, which is a "partnership, association, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization" that may be designated pursuant to IEEPA. Tornado Cash's organizational structure consists of: (1) its founders and other associated developers, who together launched the Tornado Cash mixing service, developed new Tornado Cash mixing service features, created the Tornado Cash Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), and actively promoted the platform's popularity in an attempt to increase its user base; and (2) the Tornado Cash DAO, which is responsible for voting on and implementing new features created by the developers.

##### Van Loon v. Department of the Treasury (5th Circuit) <a href="#van-loon" id="van-loon"></a>

The questions left open by the designation and FAQs were substantially answered by the Fifth Circuit's landmark decision in _Van Loon v. Department of the Treasury_, No. 23-50669 (5th Cir. 2024).

The case originated in the Western District of Texas, where six plaintiffs — users of Tornado Cash — challenged the designation under the Administrative Procedure Act and IEEPA. On August 17, 2023, Judge Robert Pitman granted summary judgment for Treasury, ruling that Tornado Cash's immutable smart contracts constituted "property" under IEEPA and that the Tornado Cash DAO had an "interest" in those contracts sufficient to support the designation. _Van Loon v. Dep't of the Treasury_, No. 1:23-cv-00312, 2023 WL 5313091 (W.D. Tex. Aug. 17, 2023).

On November 26, 2024, a unanimous three-judge panel of the Fifth Circuit **reversed**, holding that OFAC exceeded its statutory authority by sanctioning Tornado Cash's immutable smart contracts. [_Van Loon v. Dep't of the Treasury_](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca5/23-50669/23-50669-2024-11-26.html), No. 23-50669 (5th Cir. Nov. 26, 2024). The court's reasoning rested on two central holdings:

**First**, the court held that immutable smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain are **not "property"** within the meaning of IEEPA. The court reasoned that property, by definition, must be capable of being owned, controlled, and excluded from others' use. Once deployed, these self-executing smart contracts cannot be changed, deleted, or restricted by any person or entity — including the developers who originally wrote and deployed them. Because no person or entity can exercise the hallmarks of ownership over immutable smart contracts, they fall outside the statutory definition of "property" that IEEPA authorizes the President (and by delegation, OFAC) to block.

**Second**, the court declined to defer to OFAC's interpretation of "property" under IEEPA. Citing the Supreme Court's then-recent decision in _Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo_, 144 S. Ct. 2244 (2024), which overruled _Chevron_ deference, the court held that the question of whether immutable smart contracts constitute "property" is one for the courts to decide under ordinary principles of statutory construction. The court found that IEEPA's text, read against common-law and statutory understandings of property, does not encompass autonomous code that no one owns or controls.

The court was careful to limit its holding: the sanctions on the Tornado Cash **entity** — its founders, associated developers, and the DAO — remained valid and were not challenged. Only the designation of the immutable smart contracts themselves was invalidated. The court reversed and remanded with instructions to grant plaintiffs' partial summary judgment under the APA.

The implications of _Van Loon_ are significant. OFAC retains full authority to sanction persons and entities — including protocol developers and DAO participants — but open-source, immutable code deployed on a blockchain falls outside OFAC's designation authority under current statutory law. The decision effectively establishes a distinction between custodied protocols (like Blender.io), which remain subject to designation, and truly decentralized, immutable protocols whose code cannot be sanctioned as "property." The government did not seek en banc rehearing or petition for certiorari, and the decision stands as the only appellate-level ruling on point.

##### OFAC Delists Tornado Cash (March 2025) <a href="#tornado-cash-delisting" id="tornado-cash-delisting"></a>

On March 21, 2025, OFAC officially removed Tornado Cash — including the protocol's front-end website and the immutable smart contract addresses — from the SDN List. OFAC, Press Release, [Treasury Removes Tornado Cash from SDN List](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0057) (2025.03.21). Treasury stated the delisting was "[b]ased on the Administration's review of the novel legal and policy issues raised by use of financial sanctions against financial and commercial activity occurring within evolving technology and legal environments." Notably, Treasury did not concede the delisting was compelled by the Fifth Circuit ruling, instead stating it had "exercised [its] discretion."

The delisting was not total, however. **Roman Semenov**, co-founder of Tornado Cash, remains on the SDN List. OFAC removed Semenov from cyber-related sanctions but maintained his designation under North Korea sanctions authorities, asserting he "materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, the Government of North Korea." DOJ's criminal prosecution of Semenov (who remains at large) also continues. _See_ [below](ofac.md#roman-storm).

##### Coin Center v. Yellen — Vacated as Moot <a href="#coin-center-v-yellen" id="coin-center-v-yellen"></a>

The parallel challenge brought by Coin Center — filed in October 2022 in the Northern District of Florida — also reached resolution, though not on the merits. _See_ [_Coin Center v. Yellen_](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/65418276/coin-center-v-yellen/)_,_ 22-cv-20375 (N.D. Fla. 2022). The district court had ruled in October 2023 that Tornado Cash qualified as an "association" whose smart contracts amounted to blocked property under IEEPA, granting summary judgment to Treasury. Coin Center appealed to the Eleventh Circuit (Docket No. 23-13698).

Following the Fifth Circuit's November 2024 ruling in _Van Loon_ and OFAC's March 2025 delisting, the factual injury alleged by Coin Center was effectively erased. Both parties filed a joint motion asking the Eleventh Circuit to vacate the district court ruling and remand with instructions to dismiss for mootness. On July 3, 2025, the Eleventh Circuit granted the request, **vacated** the Northern District of Florida's 2023 order upholding Treasury's sanctions, and instructed the lower court to enter a dismissal. The vacatur means the N.D. Florida ruling upholding OFAC's authority is no longer precedent. The only appellate-level ruling on the sanctionability of immutable smart contracts is the Fifth Circuit's _Van Loon_ decision.

##### Roman Storm Criminal Prosecution <a href="#roman-storm" id="roman-storm"></a>

Separate from the civil challenges to the OFAC designation, the DOJ pursued criminal charges against Tornado Cash's founders. On August 23, 2023, a federal grand jury in the Southern District of New York unsealed an indictment charging Roman Storm and Roman Semenov (at large) with three counts: (1) conspiracy to commit money laundering (max 20 years), (2) conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business (max 5 years), and (3) conspiracy to commit sanctions violations under IEEPA (max 20 years). DOJ, Press Release, [Tornado Cash Founders Charged with Money Laundering and Sanctions Violations](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/tornado-cash-founders-charged-money-laundering-and-sanctions-violations) (2023.08.23). The indictment alleged Tornado Cash was used to launder more than $1 billion in criminal proceeds, including hundreds of millions for the Lazarus Group.

Storm's motion to dismiss was denied on September 26, 2024, and the case proceeded to trial. The DOJ's posture shifted before trial in two important respects: first, OFAC delisted Tornado Cash in March 2025, complicating the sanctions conspiracy charge (Count 3); second, the DOJ issued a memorandum titled "Ending Regulation by Prosecution" on April 7, 2025, directing prosecutors not to charge regulatory violations in digital asset cases unless the defendant willfully and knowingly violated registration requirements.

Following a four-week trial in mid-2025, the jury returned a **mixed verdict** on August 6, 2025. Storm was **convicted on Count 2** — conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business (max 5 years) — but the **jury deadlocked on Count 1** (money laundering conspiracy) and **Count 3** (sanctions violations conspiracy), with no verdict reached on the most serious charges. DOJ, Press Release, [Founder of Tornado Cash Crypto Mixing Service Convicted of Knowingly Transmitting Criminal Proceeds](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/founder-tornado-cash-crypto-mixing-service-convicted-knowingly-transmitting-criminal) (2025.08.06). The government retains the option to retry on the deadlocked counts. Post-trial motions were extended through December 2025.

The mixed verdict — particularly the jury's inability to reach consensus on the sanctions violation charge — may reflect broader uncertainty about the legal obligations of developers who create decentralized protocols. The outcome stands in tension with the DOJ's own April 2025 policy memo and illustrates the evolving and unsettled nature of criminal liability for protocol developers.

#### Sinbad.io (November 2023) <a href="#sinbad-io" id="sinbad-io"></a>

On November 29, 2023, OFAC designated Sinbad.io, a virtual currency mixer believed by some industry experts to be a successor to Blender.io. OFAC, Press Release, [Treasury Sanctions Sinbad.io Virtual Currency Mixer](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1933) (2023.11.29). Sinbad served as a key money-laundering tool of the Lazarus Group, processing millions of dollars in virtual currency from major North Korean heists including the Horizon Bridge heist (~$100 million, June 2022), the Axie Infinity / Ronin Bridge heist (~$620 million, March 2022), and the Atomic Wallet theft (~$100 million, June 2023). Sinbad was also used by cybercriminals for drug trafficking, child sexual abuse materials, and darknet marketplace transactions. Simultaneously with the OFAC designation, law enforcement — including the FBI, Dutch FIOD, and Finnish authorities — seized Sinbad's infrastructure.

#### ChipMixer Takedown (March 2023) <a href="#chipmixer" id="chipmixer"></a>

On March 15, 2023, a coordinated takedown by the FBI, Europol, and German police (BKA) resulted in the seizure of ChipMixer, a Bitcoin mixing service, and DOJ charges against its founder, Minh Quoc Nguyen. DOJ, Press Release, [Justice Department Investigation Leads to Takedown of Darknet Cryptocurrency Mixer that Processed Over $3 Billion](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-investigation-leads-takedown-darknet-cryptocurrency-mixer-processed-over-3) (2023.03.15). Between August 2017 and March 2023, ChipMixer processed over $3 billion in Bitcoin, including over $700 million associated with stolen funds from North Korean cyber actors (Ronin Bridge, Horizon Bridge) and over $200 million associated with darknet markets. German authorities seized $46 million in cryptocurrency and ChipMixer's back-end servers. Note that ChipMixer was a DOJ/law enforcement action, not an OFAC SDN designation.

#### Samourai Wallet (April 2024) <a href="#samourai-wallet" id="samourai-wallet"></a>

In April 2024, the DOJ charged Keonne Rodriguez (CEO) and William Lonergan Hill (CTO) of Samourai Wallet with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. DOJ, Press Release, [Founders of Samourai Wallet, Cryptocurrency Mixing Service, Sentenced to Five and Four Years in Prison](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/founders-samourai-wallet-cryptocurrency-mixing-service-sentenced-five-and-four-years) (2024). Samourai Wallet facilitated more than $2 billion in Bitcoin transactions, including $237 million in criminal proceeds, with over $100 million tied to darknet markets. The wallet offered "Whirlpool" (a CoinJoin mixing feature) and "Ricochet" (an anti-surveillance feature). Both defendants ultimately pleaded guilty; Rodriguez was sentenced to five years in prison and Hill to four years. Like ChipMixer, this was a DOJ prosecution rather than an OFAC SDN designation, but it reflects the broader federal enforcement posture toward mixing services during this period.

### State-Sponsored Crypto Threats <a href="#state-sponsored-crypto-threats" id="state-sponsored-crypto-threats"></a>

The period from 2022 through early 2026 saw a significant expansion of OFAC designations targeting state-sponsored cryptocurrency threats. These designations cut across multiple sanctions programs but share a common thread: the use of virtual currency by hostile state actors to evade sanctions, fund weapons programs, and finance terrorism.

**North Korea / DPRK.** North Korea's Lazarus Group remains the single largest justification for crypto-related OFAC designations. The Lazarus Group and related DPRK cyber units were responsible for some of the largest cryptocurrency thefts in history, including the $620 million Ronin Bridge hack (March 2022) and the $100 million Horizon Bridge hack (June 2022). In addition to designating mixers used to launder these proceeds (Blender.io, Tornado Cash, Sinbad.io), OFAC designated the DPRK's Technical Reconnaissance Bureau and its subordinate 110th Research Center — the entities that develop offensive cyber capabilities — in May 2023. A parallel threat emerged in the form of DPRK IT worker schemes, in which thousands of North Korean workers fraudulently obtain remote employment globally and funnel cryptocurrency earnings to the regime. OFAC conducted multiple rounds of designations against these networks in 2025. _See_ [Virtual Currency Addresses](ofac.md#virtual-currency-addresses) above.

**Russia.** Beyond the exchanges and darknet markets discussed in [Specific Entities / Markets](ofac.md#specific-entities-markets), OFAC designated Russian national Ekaterina Zhdanova on November 3, 2023, for laundering and moving funds using virtual currencies on behalf of Russian elites, including exchanging over $2 million in Bitcoin for Tether (USDT) via the already-designated Garantex exchange. OFAC also sanctioned Moscow-based fintech companies B-Crypto, Masterchain, Laitkhaus, and Atomaiz for providing services to sanctioned Russian banks. The progression from Garantex's initial designation (April 2022) through the Cryptex and PM2BTC designations (September 2024) and Garantex's re-designation alongside its successor Grinex (August 2025) shows sustained and escalating focus on Russian crypto-enabled sanctions evasion.

**Hamas.** Following Hamas's October 7, 2023 terrorist attack on Israel, OFAC undertook multiple rounds of sanctions targeting Hamas financial networks with significant crypto-related components. Initial designations in October 2023 targeted Hamas operatives and financial facilitators, including Buy Cash Money and Money Transfer Company, a Gaza-based money services business. OFAC, Press Release, [Treasury Sanctions Hamas Operatives and Financial Facilitators](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1816) (2023.10). Subsequent rounds targeted financial exchange networks that facilitated cryptocurrency transfers from the IRGC-Qods Force to Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. OFAC, Press Release, [Treasury Sanctions Network of Hamas Financial Facilitators](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2036) (2024.01). In a joint action with the UK's Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation on March 27, 2024, OFAC designated Gaza Now — a social media outlet that solicited donations for Hamas via cryptocurrency, receiving nearly $4.5 million — along with its founder Mustafa Ayash and associated entities. OFAC, Press Release, [Treasury and OFSI Designate Gaza Now](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2213) (2024.03.27).

**Iran / Houthis.** OFAC expanded crypto-related designations targeting Iranian networks throughout 2024 and 2025. In December 2024, OFAC updated its designation of IRGC-connected Houthi financier Sa'id al-Jamal to include cryptocurrency wallets used to facilitate money laundering and illicit shipping of Iranian oil. On April 2, 2025, OFAC sanctioned a Houthi network and identified eight cryptocurrency wallets used to support weapons and commodities procurement. In September 2025, OFAC targeted a $600 million Iranian shadow banking network in which Iranian nationals coordinated the purchase of over $100 million worth of cryptocurrency related to Iranian oil sales between 2023 and 2025. These actions culminated in the January 2026 Zedcex/Zedxion designation — the first-ever designation of digital asset exchanges under Iran-specific financial sanctions. _See_ [Specific Entities / Markets](ofac.md#specific-entities-markets) above.

## Enforcement <a href="#enforcement" id="enforcement"></a>

Placing individuals and entities (or their aliases) on the SDN List is only the first step. OFAC also has significant enforcement authority to fine entities that violate its sanctions. It has used that authority with increasing frequency and severity in the crypto space.

### BitGo and BitPay <a href="#bitgo-and-bitpay" id="bitgo-and-bitpay"></a>

OFAC's earliest crypto enforcement actions targeted BitGo and BitPay for failing to prevent users in sanctioned territories from transacting through their platforms.

OFAC fined BitGo (via settlement) $98,830 for 183 apparent violations after it failed to prevent users in sanctioned territories from using its "hot wallet" secure digital wallet management service despite having IP addresses that should have alerted BitGo of the location. OFAC, Enforcement Release, [OFAC Enters Into $98,830 Settlement with BitGo, Inc. for Apparent Violations of Multiple Sanctions Programs Related to Digital Currency Transactions](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/20201230\_bitgo.pdf) (2020.12.30). The transactions themselves were valued at only $9,127.79. This apparently was a mitigated penalty based on BitGo's significant cooperation with OFAC and implementation of an OFAC Policy, appointing a chief compliance officer, and screening all accounts against the SDN List.

OFAC subsequently fined BitPay (through a settlement) $507,375 for 2,102 violations of multiple sanctions programs. OFAC, Enforcement Release, [OFAC Enters Into $507,375 Settlement with BitPay, Inc. for Apparent Violations of Multiple Sanctions Programs Related to Digital Currency Transactions](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/20210218\_bp.pdf) (2021.02.18). OFAC found that BitPay had allowed individuals located in the sanctioned territories of Crimea, Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Sudan, and Syria to transact with merchants in the United States "even though BitPay had location information, including \[IP] addresses and other location data, about those persons prior to effecting the transactions."

The fine is particularly notable in that it is nearly five times the "$129,000 worth of digital currency-related transactions with BitPay's merchant customers" that violated the sanctions. The agency "emphasize\[d] that OFAC obligations apply to all U.S. persons, including those involved in providing digital currency services." Crypto services should also take note that simply screening the SDN List is not sufficient for full compliance. Rather, full-field awareness of user data is necessary to ensure ongoing compliance.

### Bittrex <a href="#bittrex" id="bittrex"></a>

OFAC (along with [FinCEN](https://www.thecod3x.com/fincen/)) settled with Bittrex for over $24 million for 116,421 apparent violations of multiple sanctions programs, which permitted over $263 million in virtual currency transactions to occur. OFAC, Enforcement Release, [OFAC Settles with Bittrex, Inc. for $24,280,829.20 Related to Apparent Violations of Multiple Sanctions Programs](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/20221011\_bittrex.pdf) (2022.10.11); Treasury, [Treasury Announces Two Enforcement Actions for over $24M and $29M Against Virtual Currency Exchange Bittrex, Inc.](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1006) (2022.10.11).

### Binance OFAC Settlement ($968M, November 2023) <a href="#binance" id="binance"></a>

On November 21, 2023, OFAC reached a $968,618,825 settlement with Binance Holdings, Ltd. — the largest OFAC settlement in history. OFAC, Enforcement Release, [OFAC Settles with Binance Holdings, Ltd.](https://ofac.treasury.gov/recent-actions/20231121) (2023.11.21); [Treasury](https://www.thecod3x.com/treasury/), Press Release, [Treasury Reaches Historic Settlement with Binance](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1925) (2023.11.21). The settlement covered 1,667,153 apparent violations of multiple sanctions programs between 2017 and 2022, in which Binance engaged in the exportation of goods and services from the United States, or by U.S. persons, to users located in sanctioned jurisdictions or blocked persons.

OFAC determined that the apparent violations were not voluntarily self-disclosed and that Binance's conduct was **egregious**. As part of the settlement, Binance agreed to retain an independent compliance monitor for five years. The OFAC settlement was a component of a broader global resolution involving OFAC, [FinCEN](https://www.thecod3x.com/fincen/), the CFTC, and the DOJ requiring Binance to pay over $4.3 billion total. FinCEN's component assessed a $3.4 billion civil money penalty plus a five-year monitorship. The settlement underscores that exchanges face existential financial risk for sanctions compliance failures.

### CoinList Settlement ($1.2M, December 2023) <a href="#coinlist" id="coinlist"></a>

On December 13, 2023, OFAC settled with CoinList Markets LLC, a San Francisco-based virtual currency exchange, for $1,207,830 (with $300,000 suspended). OFAC, Enforcement Release, [OFAC Settles with CoinList Markets LLC](https://ofac.treasury.gov/media/932406/download) (2023.12.13). CoinList had processed 989 transactions on behalf of users ordinarily resident in Crimea between April 2020 and May 2022, in apparent violation of OFAC's Russia/Ukraine-Related Sanctions Regulations, totaling $1,252,280 in transaction value. The root cause was instructive: CoinList's screening protocols failed to recognize that "Crimea" or a city name in Crimea, provided in a data field other than the "country" field, indicated likely residence in Crimea. CoinList had opened 89 accounts for customers who specified "Russia" as country of residence but provided Crimean addresses. The penalty was significantly reduced from a potential maximum of nearly $327 million due to CoinList's past compliance, cooperation, and small transaction volume relative to total. CoinList agreed to invest $300,000 toward enhanced sanctions compliance controls.

## Guidance <a href="#guidance" id="guidance"></a>

OFAC's guidance for the crypto / virtual currency industry consists primarily of a lengthy PDF released in late 2021. OFAC, [Sanctions Compliance Guidance for the Virtual Currency Industry](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/recent-actions/20211015) (2021.10.15). That guidance provides a general overview of OFAC compliance considerations that apply to all individuals and organizations. It then goes on to detail specific efforts OFAC believes the virtual currency industry should take, including:

* SDN list and geographic screening;
* Developing a culture of sanctions compliance, particularly at the senior management level, supported by adequate resources, including a dedicated compliance officer;
* Implementing a sanctions compliance plan "during the testing and review process so that sanctions compliance can be accounted for as technologies are being developed and prior to launching a new product";
* Conducting routine (and perhaps ongoing) risk assessments "to identify potential sanctions issues the company is likely to encounter";
* Making use of all data available about users to effect compliance — including, e.g., IP addresses provided on login not just initial registration, and related geolocation tools;
* Transaction monitoring of both historical and ongoing transactions, both for apparent violations and to fully inform the risk assessment;
* Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures that collect detailed information about individuals and entities "during onboarding and throughout the lifecycle of the customer relationship."
* Depending on the individual/entity, this could include "examining customer transaction history for connections to sanctioned jurisdictions _**or transactions with virtual currency addresses that have been linked to sanctioned actors.**_" (emphasis added). OFAC also advises that:

> \[V]irtual currency companies may consider conducting a historic lookback of transactional activity after OFAC lists a virtual currency address on the SDN List to identify connections to the listed address. A lookback could also identify connections to unlisted addresses that have previously transacted with the listed address, as such unlisted addresses could also pose sanctions risk depending on the nature of those transactions. Companies in the virtual currency industry may consider deploying blockchain analytics tools that help identify and mitigate these sanctions risks.

The guidance provides many additional details for implementing an effective OFAC compliance program and crypto industry compliance officials should closely parse its suggestions.

OFAC has also taken an aggressive position against paying ransomware payments, which usually demand payment through virtual currency. OFAC, [Updated Advisory on Potential Sanctions Risks for Facilitating Ransomware Payments](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/ofac\_ransomware\_advisory.pdf) (2021.09.21). It advises against agreeing to make such payments wherever possible due to the national security interests at stake and because "there is no guarantee that companies will regain access to their data or be free from further attacks themselves." _Id._ at 3. If such payments must be made, however, it advises that immediately contacting OFAC and related agencies may mitigate any enforcement action OFAC might otherwise bring. _Id._ at 5.

Compliance officers may wish to familiarize themselves with OFAC's enforcement guidelines as part of their own enterprise risk assessments. [31 C.F.R. § 501 App'x A](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-31/subtitle-B/chapter-V/part-501/appendix-Appendix%20A%20to%20Part%20501).

As of February 2026, OFAC has not issued a new standalone compliance guidance document for the virtual currency industry since the October 2021 guidance. However, [Executive Order 14178](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/strengthening-american-leadership-in-digital-financial-technology/) (January 23, 2025) directed [Treasury](https://www.thecod3x.com/treasury/) to consider revising and updating the OFAC Virtual Currency Guidance. Additionally, [FinCEN](https://www.thecod3x.com/fincen/) issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on October 19, 2023, identifying international Convertible Virtual Currency Mixing (CVC mixing) as a class of transactions of primary money laundering concern under Section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act — the first time FinCEN designated an entire class of transactions as such. The proposed rule's fate remains uncertain given the Trump Administration's April 2025 policy shift toward deregulation of digital assets; no final rule has been published as of February 2026.

## Statements & Testimony <a href="#statements-testimony" id="statements-testimony"></a>

Speaking at the LINKS Conference in November 2021, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo focused on the "national security concerns around anti-money laundering, terrorist financing, and ransomware" that he believed federal regulators needed to address. Wally Adeyemo, [Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, Remarks at LINKS Conference Presented by Chainalysis](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0466) (2021.11.04). He sought to dispel the notion that Treasury "conceives of ransomware as a problem with cryptocurrency, and that in order to stop the former we must severely restrict what happens in this industry." He noted that bad actors use the internet and online banking "\[b]ut that is not a reason to get rid of online banking or cryptocurrencies. It is instead a reason to treat the misuse of virtual currencies for what it is – a cybercrime and national security problem – and that is a problem we can address together."

Adeyemo stated, however, that "mixing services, darknet markets, and nested exchanges used to launder or cash out illicit funds are at the top of our list of concerns." He concluded by advising virtual currency service providers to include compliance "at the product launch and \[to build it] into the fundamental architecture of your companies," and to not wait for the Treasury department to act.

Prior to those remarks, the most substantive ones came from Sigal Mandelker, Undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, who oversees OFAC, at the CoinDesk Consensus Conference. Sigal Mandelker, [Remarks at CoinDesk Consensus Conference](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm687) (2019.05.13).

> Sigal Mandelker, undersecretary of the Treasury in charge of Fincen and OFAC says since 2013 FinCEN has received 47K SARs mentioning bitcoin & virtual currency. [pic.twitter.com/RNqCJL6H87](https://t.co/RNqCJL6H87)
>
> — Hailey Lennon (@HaileyLennonBTC) [May 13, 2019](https://twitter.com/HaileyLennonBTC/status/1127948156036165633?ref\_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

In those remarks, Mandelker warned that bad actors frequently use new methods of value transfer to evade sanctions and that Treasury had already seen extensive efforts on the part of sanctioned entities to both use existing virtual currency channels to evade sanctions and to invent their own (e.g., national digital currencies on the part of Venezuela and Russia). She stressed the need for virtual currency businesses to establish compliance protocols at the foundation of the business, identifying through points:

> (1) register with [FinCEN](https://www.thecod3x.com/fincen/) as a money services business, ‌‌(2) develop, implement, and maintain an AML program designed "to prevent \[them] from being used to facilitate money laundering and terrorist financing," and‌‌ (3) establish record keeping, and reporting measures, including filing Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) and Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs)

These sorts of compliance protocols, Mandelker noted, had resulted in FinCEN receiving over 47,000 SARs since 2013 mentioning bitcoin or virtual currency, half which "were filed by virtual currency exchangers or administrators themselves."

Finally, regarding specific compliance with OFAC sanctions, she described four elements of a successful program, which she said must be dynamic and adapt to changing market conditions: (1) a tailored, risk-based program; (2) know-your-customer procedures; (3) preventing transactions with individuals/entities on the SDN List; (4) clear communication to customers.

Other than these remarks, members of Treasury have made largely oblique references to OFAC sanctions and digital currencies and the need to be aware of possible connections to terrorist financing. _See, e.g._, Carter Burwell, [Counselor to the Secretary, Remarks at the Washington Institute](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1233) (2020.12.15); Sigal Mandelker, Under Secretary of the Treasury, [Remarks at the 19th Annual International Conference on Counterterrorism](https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/under-secretary-mandelker-remarks-at-the-19th-annual-international-conference-on-counterterrorism-0) (2019.09.11).

The policy environment shifted significantly under [Executive Order 14178](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/strengthening-american-leadership-in-digital-financial-technology/) (January 23, 2025), which revoked the Biden Administration's Executive Order 14067 ("Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets"), prohibited the establishment of a central bank digital currency, and directed agencies to promote growth of U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins. While EO 14178 does not directly limit OFAC's sanctioning authority, it signals a policy environment more favorable to the digital asset industry. The DOJ's April 7, 2025 memorandum, "Ending Regulation by Prosecution," further narrowed the government's enforcement posture by disbanding the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team and directing prosecutors not to charge regulatory violations in digital asset cases absent willful knowledge. _See_ DOJ, [Memorandum re: Ending Regulation by Prosecution](https://www.justice.gov/dag/media/1395781/dl?inline=) (2025.04.07). The tension between aggressive OFAC designations of foreign adversary crypto infrastructure and a domestic deregulatory stance remains a defining feature of the current policy landscape.
