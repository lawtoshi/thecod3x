# 1.20 - U.S. Dep't of the Treasury

## Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

The U.S. Department of the Treasury has been one of the most consequential federal actors in the development of digital asset policy. Its engagement began in earnest with a focus on stablecoins: Treasury chaired the President's Working Group on Financial Markets (PWG), which issued an influential November 2021 report calling on Congress to enact a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers. Secretary Janet Yellen amplified that report through repeated congressional testimony in 2022, urging lawmakers to act — with particular urgency following the collapse of the Terra UST algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022 and the implosion of FTX in November 2022.

Treasury's mandate expanded significantly following President Biden's March 2022 [Executive Order 14067](https://www.thecod3x.com/exec/), which directed the department to produce a suite of reports on the implications of digital assets for consumers, payments, illicit finance, and international engagement. Treasury released three major reports in September 2022, followed by the first-ever DeFi illicit finance risk assessment in April 2023, three national risk assessments in February 2024, and the first-ever NFT illicit finance risk assessment in May 2024. These publications established Treasury as the federal government's primary intellectual architect for digital asset risk frameworks.

The transition from the Biden to the Trump administration in January 2025 marked a dramatic inflection point. Executive Order 14178, signed on January 23, 2025, revoked EO 14067 in its entirety, prohibited all federal CBDC initiatives, and established a new Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets chaired by the White House AI & Crypto Czar. The new order directed Treasury to revoke its July 2022 Framework for International Engagement on Digital Assets and signaled a fundamental reorientation from risk mitigation toward innovation promotion.

Secretary Scott Bessent, confirmed on January 27, 2025 by a vote of 68-29, has charted a markedly different course from his predecessor. Where Secretary Yellen warned of systemic risks and called for restrictive legislation, Secretary Bessent has described stablecoins as "a revolution in digital finance" and declared that the administration is "building the Golden Age of Crypto." Treasury's posture shifted from caution to active facilitation — exemplified by the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in March 2025, funded by bitcoin obtained through forfeiture proceedings.

The most significant legislative milestone in Treasury's digital asset portfolio is the GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act), signed into law on July 18, 2025. The Act assigns Treasury a central role: the Secretary chairs the Stablecoin Certification Review Committee, the department holds rulemaking authority over key provisions, and it retains sanctions enforcement powers over illicit stablecoin activity. Treasury published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on September 18, 2025 to begin implementation.

As of February 2026, Treasury's digital asset policy spans stablecoin regulation under the GENIUS Act, management of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, sanctions enforcement through [OFAC](https://www.thecod3x.com/ofac/), anti-money laundering oversight through [FinCEN](https://www.thecod3x.com/fincen/), and advocacy for market structure legislation. Secretary Bessent has urged Congress to pass the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (CLARITY Act) and warned that industry participants opposing regulation should "move to El Salvador."

## Stablecoins <a href="#stablecoins" id="stablecoins"></a>

### President's Working Group on Financial Markets <a href="#president-s-working-group-on-financial-markets" id="president-s-working-group-on-financial-markets"></a>

In November 2021, the President's Working Group on Financial Markets (chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury) coordinated with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to release a report on the uses, risks, and opportunities for stablecoins. _See_ President's Working Group on Financial Markets, the FDIC, and the OCC, [_Report on Stablecoins_](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/StableCoinReport\_Nov1\_508.pdf) (2021.11). The report outlines the various current use cases for stablecoins, documents their explosive growth over recent years, details the perceived risks (to users, to the payments system, and to the greater financial system), and issues a call to action to Congress to enact a "consistent and comprehensive regulatory framework" for stablecoins.

The key aspects of that regulatory framework, as requested by the report, are:

* limiting stablecoin issuers (and those offering redemption and maintenance of reserve assets) to entities that are insured depository institutions, and making them subject to supervision at the depository and holding company levels;
* requiring custodial wallet providers for stablecoins to be subject to federal oversight, including restrictions on lending, compliance obligations for risk management, liquidity, and capital requirements;
* limits on custodial wallet providers' affiliation with commercial entities or on use of users' transaction data; and
* ensuring the federal supervisor of a stablecoin issuer has examination and enforcement authority to require issuers to meet risk-management standards, and also has the authority to implement standards to promote interoperability among stablecoins.

[_Id._](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/StableCoinReport\_Nov1\_508.pdf) at 16–17. The report also notes that other federal regulatory agencies may have a role to play in oversight of stablecoins, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Securities Exchange Commission, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, Office of Foreign Assets Control, and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. [_Id._](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/StableCoinReport\_Nov1\_508.pdf) at 15, 18, 20. The reference to FinCEN is of particular note, because FinCEN's regulations require registering with it as a money services business (MSB) (if an institution is not subject to regulations application to traditional financial institutions, like banks), establishing an anti-money laundering program, reporting cash transactions of $10,000 or more, and filing suspicious activity reports (SARs). [_Id._](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/StableCoinReport\_Nov1\_508.pdf) at 20. Doing so may cause downstream compliance issues because, as the report notes, "\[c]urrent \[Bank Secrecy Act] regulations require the transfer of certain specific information well beyond what can be inferred from the blockchain resulting in non-compliance." [_Id._](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/StableCoinReport\_Nov1\_508.pdf)

The PWG's November 2021 stablecoin recommendations were subsequently echoed and expanded upon by [FSOC](https://www.thecod3x.com/fsoc/)'s October 2022 Digital Asset Financial Stability Risks report. Congressional stablecoin bills drew heavily from PWG recommendations throughout the 117th and 118th Congresses but failed to pass. The PWG's vision for stablecoin regulation was ultimately realized — in substantially modified form — through the GENIUS Act, signed into law on July 18, 2025. Notably, the GENIUS Act permits both bank and nonbank stablecoin issuers, departing from the PWG's recommendation to limit issuance to insured depository institutions.

### Statements & Remarks <a href="#statements-and-remarks" id="statements-and-remarks"></a>

Janet Yellen, Secretary of the Treasury, opined on May 10, 2022 during congressional testimony that it would be "highly appropriate" to regulate stablecoins by the end of the year due to the "many risks associated with cryptocurrencies" and the need for "a consistent federal framework." Jacquelyn Melinek, TechCrunch.com, [_US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen Pushes for Stablecoin Regulation by End of Year_](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/10/us-treasury-secretary-janet-yellen-pushes-for-stablecoin-regulation-by-end-of-year/) (2022.05.10).

Two days later Yellen followed up on those remarks in additional congressional testimony, calling again for a "federal prudential framework" for stablecoins precisely due to the implosion of the algorithmic stablecoin Terra UST ($UST) (more on that [here](https://www.thecod3x.com/luna-terra-stablecoins/)). She did note, however, that "there are significant differences between" algorithmic and collateralized stablecoins that should inform the regulatory approach. Yellen also said — although quite tentatively — that the Treasury would be open to considering alternatives to having stablecoins exclusively issued by and domiciled in banks. YouTube.com, [_Hybrid Hearing - The Annual Report of the Financial Stability Oversight Council_](https://youtu.be/kU0xYBRfgvU?t=1477) (2022.05.12).

On February 6, 2024, Secretary Yellen testified before the House Financial Services Committee that Congress should "pass legislation to provide for the regulation of stablecoins, and of the spot market for crypto assets that are not securities." She identified regulatory gaps, noting that "the CFTC, for example, doesn't have supervisory regulatory authority with respect to spot markets in commodities like Bitcoin." Yellen stated a federal regulator should be able to shut down a stablecoin issuer that does not meet a nationwide "regulatory floor" and described stablecoin regulation as "critical" to protect wallet holders. Treasury, [_Remarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen Before the House Financial Services Committee_](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2077) (2024.02.06).

Secretary Bessent's stablecoin remarks have struck a markedly different tone. On July 18, 2025, upon the signing of the GENIUS Act, Bessent stated: "Stablecoins represent a revolution in digital finance. The dollar now has an internet-native payment rail that is fast, frictionless, and free of middlemen." He described the legislation as "groundbreaking technology" that "will buttress the dollar's status as the global reserve currency." Treasury, [_Statement from Secretary Scott Bessent on the Signing of the GENIUS Act_](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0197) (2025.07.18). On February 5, 2026, Secretary Bessent testified before the Senate Banking Committee that it is "impossible to proceed without" the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, calling out crypto "nihilists" who "prefer no regulation over this very good regulation" and warning that China could challenge U.S. pre-eminence in digital assets via Hong Kong.

## Executive Order 14067 Framework <a href="#eo-14067-framework" id="eo-14067-framework"></a>

President Biden signed [Executive Order 14067](https://www.thecod3x.com/exec/) on March 9, 2022, directing Treasury and other federal agencies to produce a comprehensive suite of reports on digital assets. EO 14067 was revoked in its entirety by Executive Order 14178 on January 23, 2025, but the reports and risk assessments it generated remain significant reference points for understanding federal digital asset policy.

### EO 14067 Reports (September 2022) <a href="#eo-14067-reports" id="eo-14067-reports"></a>

On September 16, 2022, Treasury released three major reports pursuant to EO 14067:

**Report 1: "Crypto-Assets: Implications for Consumers, Investors, and Businesses."** Issued under EO 14067 Section 5(b)(i), this report reviewed the implications of digital asset adoption for U.S. consumers, investors, businesses, and equitable economic growth. It recommended that regulatory and law enforcement authorities "aggressively pursue investigations and bring civil and criminal actions," urged regulatory agencies to continue using existing authorities, and called for coordinated consumer and investor education efforts. Treasury, [_Crypto-Assets: Implications for Consumers, Investors, and Businesses_](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/CryptoAsset_EO5.pdf) (2022.09.16).

**Report 2: "The Future of Money and Payments."** Issued under EO 14067 Section 4, this report examined the U.S. system of money and payments, including innovations such as instant payments, stablecoins, and a potential U.S. CBDC. It recommended advancing work on a possible CBDC in consultation with the Federal Reserve and encouraged the use of instant payment systems, including FedNow. Treasury, [_The Future of Money and Payments_](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Future-of-Money-and-Payments.pdf) (2022.09.16).

**Report 3: "Action Plan to Address Illicit Financing Risks of Digital Assets."** Issued under EO 14067 Section 7, this report identified seven priority actions including monitoring emerging risks, working with international partners, strengthening U.S. AML/CFT regulations, improving private-sector compliance, and enhancing information sharing. Key vulnerabilities identified included the cross-border nature of crypto, gaps in AML/CFT regimes, anonymity-enhancing technologies, and VASP compliance deficiencies. Treasury, [_Action Plan to Address Illicit Financing Risks of Digital Assets_](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Digital-Asset-Action-Plan.pdf) (2022.09.16).

### Request for Comment and Public Input <a href="#request-for-comment" id="request-for-comment"></a>

Treasury issued two requests for comment (RFCs) in connection with the EO 14067 framework.

The first, published on July 8, 2022, solicited comment on "any matter that commenters believe is relevant to Treasury's development of the report on the implications of developments and adoption of digital assets and changes in financial market and payment infrastructures for United States consumers, investors, businesses, and for equitable economic growth." Treasury Department, [_Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets; Request for Comment_](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/07/08/2022-14588/ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets-request-for-comment), 87 Fed. Reg. 40881, 40882 (2022.07.08). Comments were due by August 8, 2022. The public comments informed Treasury's September 16, 2022 report on implications for consumers, investors, and businesses, though Treasury did not publish a formal summary of comments received.

The second, published on September 20, 2022, sought input on digital-asset-related illicit finance and national security risks in connection with the Action Plan. Treasury Department, [_Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets; Request for Comment_](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/20/2022-20279/ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets-request-for-comment), 87 Fed. Reg. 57556 (2022.09.20). Comments were due by November 3, 2022, and informed subsequent Treasury actions including the April 2023 DeFi Illicit Finance Risk Assessment, the October 2023 [FinCEN](https://www.thecod3x.com/fincen/) mixer rule proposal, and the 2024 national risk assessments.

### DeFi Illicit Finance Risk Assessment (April 2023) <a href="#defi-risk-assessment" id="defi-risk-assessment"></a>

On April 6, 2023, Treasury published the first-ever illicit finance risk assessment of decentralized finance conducted by any government worldwide. The assessment found that ransomware cybercriminals, thieves, scammers, and DPRK (North Korea) cyber actors use DeFi services to transfer and launder illicit proceeds. Treasury identified the most significant illicit finance risk as DeFi services that fail to comply with existing AML/CFT obligations. Key vulnerabilities included some DeFi services potentially falling outside the Bank Secrecy Act definition of "financial institution," weak AML/CFT controls in other jurisdictions, and poor cybersecurity controls enabling theft. Treasury recommended closing gaps in BSA applicability, strengthening enforcement, and enhancing international cooperation. Treasury, [_DeFi Illicit Finance Risk Assessment_](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/DeFi-Risk-Full-Review.pdf) (2023.04.06).

### National Risk Assessments (February 2024) <a href="#national-risk-assessments" id="national-risk-assessments"></a>

On February 7, 2024, Treasury published three national risk assessments covering money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing. Treasury, [_Press Release: Treasury Releases 2024 National Risk Assessments_](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2080) (2024.02.07).

The **National Money Laundering Risk Assessment** stated that the use of virtual assets for money laundering "remains far below that of fiat currency" but is growing, and identified six key crypto-related risk areas: inconsistent AML compliance among VASPs, obfuscation tools (privacy coins, chain-hopping), mixing services, unhosted wallets and peer-to-peer transactions, DeFi ecosystem risks, and disintermediation. Treasury, [_2024 National Money Laundering Risk Assessment_](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/2024-National-Money-Laundering-Risk-Assessment.pdf) (2024.02.07).

The **National Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment** cited the use of stablecoins by terrorist organizations and flagged North Korea's use of virtual currency mixers and DeFi protocols to finance illicit weapons programs. Treasury, [_2024 National Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment_](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/2024-National-Terrorist-Financing-Risk-Assessment.pdf) (2024.02.07).

The **National Proliferation Financing Risk Assessment** found that DPRK networks are increasingly exploiting the digital economy through hacking of VASPs and deploying fraudulent overseas IT workers, and that U.S. VASP compliance deficiencies make the U.S. vulnerable to proliferation financing networks. Treasury, [_2024 National Proliferation Financing Risk Assessment_](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/2024-National-Proliferation-Financing-Risk-Assessment.pdf) (2024.02.07).

## NFTs <a href="#nfts" id="nfts"></a>

The pace of non-fungible tokens' (NFTs) growth was astonishing at its peak: over $1.5 billion in NFT sales occurred in just the first quarter of 2021. That amounted to approximately 7.5% of the total 2020 U.S. art market, which clocked in at over $20 billion. Treasury, [_Study of the Facilitation of Money Laundering and Terror Finance Through the Trade in Works of Art_](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Treasury\_Study\_WoA.pdf), at 26 (2022.02).

Traditional art mediums are an appealing way for criminals to launder their money. The art is a high value object, it's difficult to track a work's movement until it resurfaces for public sale, and the buyer/seller markets are extremely opaque. With this backdrop, it is little surprise that Treasury took a close look at the new art market taking form in NFTs. The Treasury's understanding of NFTs, as reflected in its February 2022 study, appeared limited in certain respects.

For example, Treasury defined NFTs as "bearer instruments that codify the ownership of a unique digital asset," which is generally true, but the bundle of property rights that come with any given NFT varies widely, and how those rights are transferred on the sale of an NFT has not been codified in the same way as more traditional bearer instruments such as checks, cash, or government bonds. _Id._

Treasury also seemed to have a conflicting view of how trades in NFTs are conducted. On the one hand, it noted that "NFTs are publicly verifiable, auditable, and digitally unique due to being derived cryptographically." _Id._ But on the other hand, it stated that "\[i]t is also possible to have direct peer-to-peer transactions . . . and these transactions may or may not be recorded on a public ledger." _Id._ at 27. But the only way a transfer of an NFT could occur and _not_ be on a public ledger would be through an off-chain exchange of ownership of the wallet containing the NFT, which would have troubling security implications for a buyer going this route – a risk those purchasing NFTs of any significant value would be unlikely to take.

On the other hand, Treasury noted that NFTs present an appealing avenue to "launder illicit proceeds of crime, because the movement of value can be accomplished without incurring potential financial, regulatory, or investigative costs of physical shipment." _Id._ While that appeal is obvious, the public recordation of every transaction tempers its usefulness.

Treasury next correctly stated that NFT marketplaces function fundamentally differently from traditional gallerists who have "an incentive to increase awareness about artists they represent, and to protect the reputation of the gallery." _Id._ In contrast, operators of NFT marketplaces earn fees based on transaction volume and thus "create an incentive to shape a marketplace where the work is traded repeatedly in a short period." This causes Treasury concern because "the incentive to transact can potentially be higher than the incentive to verify the identity of the buyer of the work, or even can create a situation where it is not possible to conduct due diligence if transactions are conducted in rapid succession." _Id._ This sentiment does not, however, address the comparatively minimal role that NFT marketplaces play compared to traditional gallerists. Nor did Treasury lay out a framework for when NFT exchanges must engage in Know-Your-Customer (KYC) compliance for either buyers, sellers, or both.

Finally, and perhaps most importantly for those in the business of facilitating the exchange of NFTs, Treasury concluded that "\[d]epending on the nature and characteristics of the NFTs offered, these platforms may be considered virtual asset service providers (VASP) by \[Financial Action Task Force (FATF)] and may come under FinCEN's regulations." _Id._ at 26. But the report immediately hedged by saying that NFTs that are "unique, rather than interchangeable, and that are used in practice as collectibles rather than as payment or investment instruments . . . are generally not considered to be virtual assets under the FATF definition." _Id._

Nevertheless, if the NFTs traded on a platform are used primarily for "payment or investment purposes in practice," this may trigger designation of a marketplace as a VASP, and therefore subject it to [FinCEN](https://www.thecod3x.com/fincen/) regulation. _Id._ Treasury did not provide further detail on the specific criteria that would subject a marketplace to either the FATF designation or FinCEN oversight.

### NFT Illicit Finance Risk Assessment (May 2024) <a href="#nft-risk-assessment" id="nft-risk-assessment"></a>

On May 29, 2024, Treasury published the first-ever NFT illicit finance risk assessment, building on the analytical foundation of its February 2022 art market study. The assessment found that NFTs are "highly susceptible to use in fraud and scams" and subject to theft, and that illicit actors can use NFTs to launder proceeds from predicate crimes, often combined with other obfuscation methods. Notably, the assessment found "little evidence" of misuse by terrorists or proliferators — in contrast to the significant fraud and scam activity identified. Inadequate cybersecurity protections and fluctuating NFT pricing were identified as enablers of criminal exploitation. Treasury, [_Illicit Finance Risk Assessment of Non-Fungible Tokens_](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Illicit-Finance-Risk-Assessment-of-Non-Fungible-Tokens.pdf) (2024.05.29).

Treasury recommended three courses of action: (1) raising awareness of existing regulatory obligations within the NFT industry; (2) continuing to enforce existing laws and regulations; and (3) considering further application of AML/CFT regulations to NFTs and NFT platforms. Importantly, the report concluded that enforcing existing AML/CFT rules is more appropriate than creating entirely new NFT-specific regulations — a measured approach that leaves significant interpretive latitude in the hands of [FinCEN](https://www.thecod3x.com/fincen/) and the [IRS](https://www.thecod3x.com/irs/). _Id._

## CBDC <a href="#cbdc" id="cbdc"></a>

### Biden Administration: Study and Advancement <a href="#cbdc-biden" id="cbdc-biden"></a>

[Executive Order 14067](https://www.thecod3x.com/exec/) stated that the U.S. government "should prioritize timely assessments of potential benefits and risks \[of a U.S. CBDC] under various designs." Treasury's September 2022 report, "The Future of Money and Payments," recommended advancing work on a possible U.S. CBDC in consultation with the Federal Reserve, but did not take a definitive position on whether to pursue one. On March 1, 2023, Under Secretary for Domestic Finance Nellie Liang announced that Treasury would lead a new senior-level interagency CBDC Working Group to consider implications across areas including global financial leadership, national security, privacy, illicit finance, and financial inclusion. Treasury, [_Under Secretary for Domestic Finance Nellie Liang's Remarks on Digital Assets_](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1314) (2023.03.01). The Biden administration's CBDC posture was one of studied engagement: exploring potential benefits without committing to development or issuance.

### Trump Administration: Prohibition (EO 14178) <a href="#cbdc-trump" id="cbdc-trump"></a>

Executive Order 14178, signed on January 23, 2025, reversed the Biden administration's approach entirely. The order prohibits agencies from "undertaking any action to establish, issue, or promote a CBDC" and requires them to "terminate any plans or initiatives related to the creation of a CBDC." The order cited concerns including risks to the financial system, loss of privacy, and potential government overreach. Executive Order 14178, [_Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology_](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/strengthening-american-leadership-in-digital-financial-technology/) (2025.01.23). At his January 16, 2025 Senate Finance Committee confirmation hearing, Secretary Bessent reinforced this position, stating: "I see no reason for the U.S. to have a central bank digital currency," calling it something "for countries who have no other investment alternatives."

## The Trump Administration and Digital Asset Policy <a href="#trump-administration" id="trump-administration"></a>

### Executive Order 14178 (January 23, 2025) <a href="#eo-14178" id="eo-14178"></a>

Executive Order 14178, titled "Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology," represents the most significant policy shift in federal digital asset regulation since EO 14067. Its key provisions include:

* declaring U.S. policy to support the responsible growth and use of digital assets, blockchain technology, and related technologies;
* prohibiting the establishment, issuance, or promotion of CBDCs;
* establishing the President's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, chaired by the White House AI & Crypto Czar (David Sacks);
* directing the Working Group to submit regulatory and legislative framework recommendations within 180 days;
* revoking EO 14067 in its entirety and directing Treasury to revoke the July 2022 Framework for International Engagement on Digital Assets; and
* directing agencies to identify and rescind regulations or guidance that inhibit digital asset development.

Executive Order 14178, [_Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology_](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/31/2025-02123), 90 Fed. Reg. 8763 (2025.01.23).

### Secretary Bessent <a href="#secretary-bessent" id="secretary-bessent"></a>

Scott Bessent was confirmed as the 79th Secretary of the Treasury on January 27, 2025, by a bipartisan vote of 68-29. His tenure has been defined by an aggressive pro-digital-asset posture that contrasts sharply with the risk-oriented approach of Secretary Yellen.

Secretary Bessent's key statements include his July 30, 2025 remarks at the launch of the White House Digital Assets Report, in which he announced "America's digital asset frontier is open again" and characterized the administration's efforts as "building the Golden Age of Crypto." Treasury, [_Remarks by Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent at the Launch of the White House Digital Assets Report_](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0216) (2025.07.30). He has described stablecoins as potentially "an important feature of financing the U.S. government" and stated that "crypto is not a threat to the dollar. In fact, stablecoins can reinforce dollar supremacy."

On February 5, 2026, Secretary Bessent testified before the Senate Banking Committee, urging passage of the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (CLARITY Act). He called out "nihilists" in the crypto industry who "prefer no regulation over this very good regulation," told resistant industry participants to "move to El Salvador," and warned that China could challenge U.S. pre-eminence in digital assets via Hong Kong.

### Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (March 6, 2025) <a href="#strategic-bitcoin-reserve" id="strategic-bitcoin-reserve"></a>

On March 6, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order establishing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile. The Reserve is capitalized with bitcoin owned by the federal government through forfeiture proceedings — estimated at more than 207,000 BTC (approximately $17 billion as of March 2025). Government bitcoin deposited into the Reserve shall not be sold and is to be maintained as reserve assets. A separate U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile was established for other digital assets. The order directed agency heads to provide the Secretary of the Treasury and the Working Group with a full accounting of all federal bitcoin and digital asset holdings within 30 days. Executive Order, [_Establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile_](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/11/2025-03992/establishment-of-the-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-and-united-states-digital-asset-stockpile) (2025.03.06).

### Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets <a href="#presidential-working-group" id="presidential-working-group"></a>

The Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, established by EO 14178 and chaired by David Sacks, released its comprehensive report on July 30, 2025. Titled "Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology," the approximately 160-page report contains over 100 regulatory and legislative action items. White House, [_Recommendations to Strengthen American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology_](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/digital-Assets-Report-EO14178.pdf) (2025.07.30).

Key recommendations include: (1) Congress should enact market structure legislation (the CLARITY Act) for the "most cost-efficient and pro-innovation regulatory structure for digital assets"; (2) Treasury and banking agencies should "faithfully and expeditiously" implement the GENIUS Act; (3) the administration should promote dollar-backed stablecoin adoption globally to reinforce the U.S. dollar's reserve currency status; (4) [FinCEN](https://www.thecod3x.com/fincen/) should modernize the SAR system to integrate blockchain-specific typologies (wallet behaviors, mixer usage, token flows, DeFi interactions); (5) prudential regulators should clarify permissible crypto activities for banks; and (6) the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve management framework should be operationalized. The report firmly opposes any CBDC initiatives, prioritizing privacy, civil liberties, and prevention of government overreach. _Id._

## GENIUS Act and Treasury Implementation <a href="#genius-act" id="genius-act"></a>

The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act), S.1582 of the 119th Congress, passed the Senate on June 17, 2025 (68-30), passed the House on July 17, 2025 (308-122), and was signed into law on July 18, 2025. Congress.gov, [_S.1582 - GENIUS Act_](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/1582/text) (2025.07.18). The Act represents the first comprehensive federal stablecoin legislation — a goal Treasury had sought since the November 2021 PWG report.

### Treasury's Roles Under the Act <a href="#treasury-genius-roles" id="treasury-genius-roles"></a>

The GENIUS Act assigns Treasury several critical functions:

* **Stablecoin Certification Review Committee (SCRC):** The Secretary of the Treasury chairs this interagency committee, which also includes the Chair of the Federal Reserve Board (or Vice Chair for Supervision) and the Chair of the FDIC. The SCRC reviews and certifies stablecoin issuers.
* **Rulemaking Authority:** Section 13 requires the Secretary of the Treasury, along with other primary regulators, to promulgate regulations through notice-and-comment rulemaking.
* **Coordination Mandate:** Treasury must coordinate with other regulators on implementing regulations and submit a report to Congress within 180 days of enactment.

* **Illicit Finance Detection:** Section 9 directs the Secretary to seek public comment on innovative methods to detect illicit activity involving digital assets.

### Rulemaking <a href="#genius-rulemaking" id="genius-rulemaking"></a>

On August 18, 2025, Treasury published a Request for Comment on innovative methods to detect illicit activity involving digital assets, fulfilling the Section 9 requirement. The RFC sought input on artificial intelligence, digital identity verification, and other novel detection methods. Treasury, [_Request for Comment on Innovative Methods to Detect Illicit Activity Involving Digital Assets_](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/08/18/2025-15697/request-for-comment-on-innovative-methods-to-detect-illicit-activity-involving-digital-assets), 90 Fed. Reg. (2025.08.18).

On September 18, 2025, Treasury published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) to begin formal implementation of the GENIUS Act. The ANPRM solicited public comment on regulatory clarity, prohibitions on certain issuances, BSA/AML/sanctions obligations, the balance of state versus federal oversight, comparable foreign regulatory regimes, and tax issues. Treasury, [_GENIUS Act Implementation; Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking_](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/09/19/2025-18226/genius-act-implementation), 90 Fed. Reg. (2025.09.19). The original comment deadline of October 20, 2025 was extended by 15 days to November 4, 2025.

## International Coordination <a href="#international-coordination" id="international-coordination"></a>

### Framework for International Engagement (July 2022) <a href="#international-framework" id="international-framework"></a>

On July 7, 2022, Treasury released a "Framework for International Engagement on Digital Assets" pursuant to EO 14067. The framework organized U.S. collaboration across the G7, G20, Financial Stability Board (FSB), FATF, and other international bodies, and outlined U.S. priorities including financial stability, illicit finance prevention, consumer protection, and promoting responsible innovation. Treasury, [_Fact Sheet: Framework for International Engagement on Digital Assets_](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0854) (2022.07.07). EO 14178 directed the Secretary of the Treasury to immediately revoke this framework on January 23, 2025, stating that it "does not reflect current U.S. Treasury or U.S. Government policy."

### G7 and G20 Coordination <a href="#g7-g20" id="g7-g20"></a>

Treasury engaged in multilateral digital asset coordination through multiple channels during 2022-2024. At the G7 level, the Digital Payments Experts Group (DPEG) continued work that began under the U.S. presidency in 2020. At the G20 level, the September 2023 India presidency saw endorsement of a comprehensive crypto-asset policy roadmap with a 2025 target for implementation review. The FSB published a G20 Crypto-asset Policy Implementation Roadmap Status Report in October 2024, finding that 62% of FSB members expected alignment with the FSB Framework for crypto-assets by 2025. FSB, [_G20 Crypto-asset Policy Implementation Roadmap: Status Report_](https://www.fsb.org/2024/10/g20-crypto-asset-policy-implementation-roadmap-status-report/) (2024.10).

The Trump administration's revocation of the international engagement framework signaled a pivot toward a U.S.-centric policy. The July 30, 2025 Presidential Working Group report articulated a new international approach focused on promoting dollar-denominated stablecoins globally and encouraging other nations to adopt U.S.-friendly regulatory frameworks — prioritizing dollar dominance over multilateral coordination.
