1. **Share** the Cod3x, any section you find helpful (the Litigation Tracker is the most popular!), or this newsletter to spread the word.
2. **Subscribe** for updates [here](https://www.lawtoshi.xyz/welcome). All content is free, but you can pay for a subscription here for any length of time if you feel this work adds value to you.
3. **Write** content directly. If you would like to contribute to an existing page or add a new one, the basic details of contributing are available publicly [here](https://twitter.com/lawtoshi/status/1623003844719550464).
